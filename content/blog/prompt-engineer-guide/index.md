# prompt examples

- **detail outlined books, articles, etc...**
  - expand in much more details with bold high-light quotes/phrases the above sections "### **Part 1: The Product Fallacy**

#### **1. The Product Fallacy**

* **Myth**: Great product success is based on good ideas, competent teams, and fast delivery.
* **Reality**: Success is unpredictable and most ideas fail.
* **Cognitive Biases**: Overconfidence, confirmation bias, and survivorship bias mislead teams.

#### **2. Most Ideas Fail**

* Cites **Google and other big tech companies** showing most features launched don‚Äôt have impact.
* Failure rate: \~70-90% of ideas fail to produce measurable results.

#### **3. Our Ideas Are Mostly Guesses**

* Most product decisions are **intuition-based guesses**, not grounded in solid evidence.
* **Experts are not always reliable** predictors of success.

#### **4. Output vs. Outcome**

* **Output (features, delivery)** ‚â† **Outcome (user value, business value)**.
* Mistaking shipping for success leads to **vanity metrics and wasted effort**."

### **Part 2: The Impact-First Mindset**

#### **5. What Are We Optimizing For?**

* Shift from ‚Äúdelivering features fast‚Äù ‚Üí **delivering impact reliably**.
* Define product success through measurable outcomes.

#### **6. Defining Impact**

* Impact = **User Value** + **Business Value**
* Introduces **GIST Framework**:

  * **Goals**
  * **Ideas**
  * **Step-projects**
  * **Tasks**

#### **7. The GIST Framework**

* **Hierarchy of alignment** from company mission to execution:

  * **Goals**: Clear, measurable outcomes.
  * **Ideas**: Raw guesses of how to achieve goals.
  * **Step Projects**: Small experiments.
  * **Tasks**: Execution items.

#### **8. Impact-First Planning**

* Plan around **impact goals** instead of timelines and deliverables.
* Use OKRs effectively to stay focused on outcomes.

---

### **Part 3: Evidence-Guided Development**

#### **9. The Evidence Ladder**

* Framework to assess ideas by the **strength of supporting evidence**:

  * **Speculation** ‚Üí **Opinions** ‚Üí **User Feedback** ‚Üí **User Behavior** ‚Üí **Business Results**

#### **10. Testing Ideas with Step Projects**

* Use **small, fast, cheap experiments** (Step Projects) to test critical assumptions.
* Avoid big-bang launches without validation.

#### **11. Learning from Data**

* Build **feedback loops** from usage data, A/B testing, and analytics.
* Emphasize **learning velocity**, not just shipping velocity.

#### **12. Prioritizing by Evidence and Value**

* Replace **gut-feel prioritization** with:

  * **ICE scoring**
  * **Confidence meter**
  * **RICE model**
* Rank ideas based on potential impact and evidence strength.

---

### **Part 4: Culture and Structure**

#### **13. Culture of Evidence-Guided Product Development**

* Shift from **authority-based to evidence-based decision making**.
* Encourage experimentation, curiosity, and user-centricity.

#### **14. Empowered Teams**

* Empower teams with:

  * **Clear goals**
  * **Autonomy**
  * **Access to users and data**
* Avoid command-and-control.

#### **15. Leadership for Impact**

* Leaders define **vision**, set **outcome goals**, and support experimentation.
* Shift from **project managers** to **impact coaches**.

#### **16. Bringing It All Together**

* Integrate GIST with agile, lean, and discovery practices.
* Emphasize **continuous impact delivery** over one-time launches.

### üìå **Appendices & Tools**

* **Confidence Meter Template**
* **Idea Bank Canvas**
* **Step Project Tracker**
* **Goal Tracker**
* References and tools for further reading.

## üß† **Key Takeaways**

* **"Most product ideas fail. The key is not avoiding failure, but failing smart and small."**
* **"Ideas are guesses. Evidence turns guesses into knowledge."**
* **"Delivering output is easy. Delivering outcome is hard‚Äîand that's the real goal."**
* **"Small experiments (Step Projects) are the best way to reduce risk."**
* **"Empowered teams that chase impact outperform teams chasing deadlines."**

Would you like me to **expand any section** (e.g. GIST framework, Confidence Meter, or Evidence Ladder) with more examples and visuals?
