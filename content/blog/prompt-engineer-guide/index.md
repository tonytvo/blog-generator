- **TDD development**

We are doing test driven development. For each task, do the following:
1. Add a test to the test file specified by the user.
2. Run the tests and ensure it fails. If it doesn't stop.
3. Add the implementation to the implementation file specified by the user.
4. Run the tests and ensure it passes. If it doesn't attempt to fix it by changing only the implementation.
5. Commit it, starting the commit message with 🤖 do denote the commit was done by you.
6. Stop and wait for the next task.

If the task involves refactoring, take small steps figure out a sequence of small moves that minimize the amount of time the code is broken. Treat each small step as a task, run the tests, and commit after each one.

If the user doesn't specify test and implementation files, stop and ask the user before continuing. DO NOT USE TOOLS TO TRY TO FIND THE FILES.

Great choice pairing these two books — they actually **complement each other beautifully**, but they come from **very different emotional philosophies**.

Below is a **clean, structured, therapist-level outline** of ***Set Boundaries, Find Peace* by Nedra Glover Tawwab**, with **practical language, emotional intelligence framing, and real-life application**, so you can clearly see how it **extends and modernizes** the ideas from **Cloud & Townsend’s *Boundaries***.

---

# **Set Boundaries, Find Peace**

### *A Guide to Reclaiming Yourself* — **Nedra Glover Tawwab**

## **Core Thesis (Big Idea)**

> **Boundaries are not about controlling others — they are about controlling your own behavior, access, energy, and time.**
> Healthy boundaries are the fastest path to **peace, self-respect, and emotionally sustainable relationships**.

This book focuses less on theology or morality and more on:

* emotional regulation
* trauma awareness
* assertive communication
* modern contexts (work, social media, family systems)

---

## **PART I — Understanding the Importance of Boundaries**

### **Chapter 1: What the Heck Are Boundaries?**

**Boundaries = expectations + limits + follow-through**

Key ideas:

* Boundaries define **what is okay and what is not okay**
* They are **communicated**, not assumed
* They protect:

  * emotional energy
  * time
  * mental health
  * values

> “People don’t know what you want. **Clarity saves relationships.**”

**Signs you need boundaries:**

* Feeling overwhelmed or resentful
* Avoiding calls/messages
* Chronic burnout
* Fantasizing about disappearing
* Saying yes while feeling angry

---

### **Chapter 2: The Cost of Not Having Healthy Boundaries**

Lack of boundaries leads to:

* burnout
* resentment
* anxiety and depression
* codependency
* toxic relationship patterns
* loss of self-trust

Key insight:

> **Resentment is often the result of unspoken or unenforced boundaries.**

---

### **Chapter 3: Why Don’t We Have Healthy Boundaries?**

Common blockers:

* Fear of conflict
* Fear of abandonment
* Guilt (“I’m being mean/selfish”)
* Family conditioning (“That’s just how we do things”)
* Trauma history
* People-pleasing identity

Important reframe:

> **Fear is not rooted in fact — it’s rooted in imagined consequences.**

---

### **Chapter 4: The Six Types of Boundaries**

Nedra’s modern boundary taxonomy:

1. **Physical** — personal space, touch, privacy
2. **Emotional** — not absorbing others’ feelings or moods
3. **Intellectual** — respecting differing opinions
4. **Time** — protecting availability and rest
5. **Material** — money, belongings, resources
6. **Sexual** — consent, comfort, expectations

Each boundary type includes:

* examples
* common violations
* how to communicate
* how to enforce

---

### **Chapter 5: What Boundary Violations Look Like**

Two levels of violations:

* **Micro (little “b”) violations**

  * guilt trips
  * oversharing
  * subtle pressure
* **Macro (Big “B”) violations**

  * abuse
  * coercion
  * chronic disrespect
  * manipulation

Patterns to recognize:

* enmeshment
* codependency
* trauma bonding
* silent treatment
* emotional dumping

---

### **Chapter 6: Identify and Communicate Your Boundaries**

The **boundary formula**:

1. Identify the issue
2. Name the boundary clearly
3. State consequences
4. Follow through consistently

Bad boundaries:

* vague
* apologetic
* over-explained
* inconsistent

Good boundaries:

* **clear**
* **brief**
* **neutral**
* **firm**

---

### **Chapter 7: Blurred Lines — Make It Plain**

Blurred boundaries happen when:

* you over-explain
* you negotiate limits
* you try to control others instead of yourself
* you build **walls** instead of **boundaries**

Difference:

* **Walls** = avoidance, shutdown
* **Boundaries** = clarity + choice

---

### **Chapter 8: Trauma and Boundaries**

Trauma impacts:

* attachment style (anxious / avoidant)
* tolerance for mistreatment
* fear of asserting needs

Key insight:

> **The treatment you tolerate teaches others how to treat you.**

Healing requires:

* self-boundaries
* therapy or support
* re-learning safety

---

### **Chapter 9: What Are You Doing to Honor Your Boundaries?**

Boundaries fail when:

* you don’t enforce them
* you expect others to “just know”
* you abandon yourself to keep peace

Honoring boundaries = **self-respect in action**

---

## **PART II — This Is How You Do the Work**

### **Chapter 10: Family**

Family systems resist change the most.

Strategies:

* reduce contact frequency
* limit conversation topics
* stop rescuing
* detach from fixing roles

> “It’s not my job to fix people.”

---

### **Chapter 11: Romantic Relationships**

Boundaries protect:

* intimacy
* individuality
* emotional safety

Topics:

* communication

* emotional labor
* shifting identities (parenthood, stress)

---

---

Burnout = **lack of boundaries**

---

Example: Nedra’s **explicit Instagram boundaries**

---

---

## **How This Book Differs from *Boundaries* (Cloud & Townsend)**

| Cloud & Townsend              | Nedra Tawwab                      |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Moral & spiritual framing     | Emotional & psychological framing |
| Responsibility & consequences | Self-regulation & peace           |
| External structure            | Internal clarity                  |
| Authority-based               | Self-trust-based                  |
| “Say no to control others”    | “Say no to protect yourself”      |

They **agree**, but speak to **different nervous systems**.

---

## **Best Use Case**

This book is ideal if you:

* feel emotionally exhausted
* grew up people-pleasing
* struggle with guilt
* want **scripts**, not theory
* need boundaries in **modern life** (work, tech, trauma)

---

If you want, next we can:

* 🔹 **merge both books into one unified boundary framework**
* 🔹 build **boundary scripts** for your real situations (work, family, ex, kids)
* 🔹 map this to your **current life stressors** (single parenthood, work pressure, grief)

Just tell me where you want to go next.
