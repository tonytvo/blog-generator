### **Part 3: Evidence-Guided Development**

#### **9. The Evidence Ladder**

* Framework to assess ideas by the **strength of supporting evidence**:

  * **Speculation** â†’ **Opinions** â†’ **User Feedback** â†’ **User Behavior** â†’ **Business Results**

#### **10. Testing Ideas with Step Projects**

* Use **small, fast, cheap experiments** (Step Projects) to test critical assumptions.
* Avoid big-bang launches without validation.

#### **11. Learning from Data**

* Build **feedback loops** from usage data, A/B testing, and analytics.
* Emphasize **learning velocity**, not just shipping velocity.

#### **12. Prioritizing by Evidence and Value**

* Replace **gut-feel prioritization** with:

  * **ICE scoring**
  * **Confidence meter**
  * **RICE model**
* Rank ideas based on potential impact and evidence strength.

## ðŸ§  **Key Takeaways**

* **"Most product ideas fail. The key is not avoiding failure, but failing smart and small."**
* **"Ideas are guesses. Evidence turns guesses into knowledge."**
* **"Delivering output is easy. Delivering outcome is hardâ€”and that's the real goal."**
* **"Small experiments (Step Projects) are the best way to reduce risk."**
* **"Empowered teams that chase impact outperform teams chasing deadlines."**

Would you like me to **expand any section** (e.g. GIST framework, Confidence Meter, or Evidence Ladder) with more examples and visuals?
