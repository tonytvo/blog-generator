# charlie's checklist

- **The Two-Track Analysis**
  - What are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered? (macro and micro-level economic factors?

  - **Analytic rigor**
    - use of the scientific method and effective checklists minimizes errors and omissions
    - Determine value apart from price; progress apart from activity; wealth apart from size
    - It is better to remember the obvious than to grasp the esoteric
    - Be a business analyst, not a market, macroeconomic, or security analyst
    - Consider totality of risk and effect; look always at potential second order and higher level impacts
    - Think forwards and backwards - invert, always invert!
  - **Allocation** 
    - proper allocation of capital is an investor's number one job
    - Remember that highest and best use is always measured by the next best use (opportunity cost)
    - Good ideas are rare - when the odds are greatly in your favor, bet (allocate) heavily
    - Don't "fall in love" with an investment -be situation-dependent and opportunity-driven
  - **Patience**
    - Resist the natural human bias to act

  - **Decisiveness**
    - when proper circumstances present themselves, act with decisiveness and conviction
    - Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful
    - Opportunity doesn't come often, so seize it when it does
    - Opportunity meeting the prepared mind: that's the game
  - **Change**
    - live with change and accept unremovable complexity
    - Recognize and adapt to the true nature of the world around you; don't expect it to adapt to you
    - Continually challenge and willingly amend your "best-loved" ideas
    - Recognize reality even when you don't like it - especially when you don't like it
  - **Focus**
    - keep things simple and remember what you set out to do
    - Remember that reputation and integrity are your most valuable assets - and can be lost in a heartbeat
    - Guard against the effects of hubris and boredom
    - Don't overlook the obvious by drowning in minutiae
    - Be careful to exclude unneeded information or slop: "A small leak can sink a great ship" 
    - Face your big troubles; don't sweep them under the rug
- **Ultra-Simple, general Problem-Solving Notions**
  - Decide the big "no-brainer" questions first
  - Apply numerical fluency
