# take-aways


# How do you make the competition irrelevant?
- Aim is not to outperform competitors it is to offer a quantum leap in value that made the competition irrelevant. 

- In overcrowded industries differentiating becomes harder and harder. 

- So, value innovation is the cornerstone of Blue ocean strategy. With it you can pursue low cost and differentiation simultaneously. 

# What is Blue Ocean Strategy?

- Blue oceans denote all the industries not in existence today. Where the rules of the game are waiting to be set. 

- To focus on the red ocean is acceptance of key constraints of war, limited terrain and need to beat enemy to succeed.  

- This denies the distinctive strength of the business world; the capacity to create new market space. 

- Value innovation achieved when system of the company’s utility, price and cost activities are properly aligned.

# The Four Actions Framework (ERRC)
- The Framework in the form of Questions:
  - Eliminate – Which of the factors that industry takes for granted should be eliminated? 
  - Reduce – Which factors should be reduced well below the industries standard? 
  - Raise – Which factors should be raised well above the industries standard? 
  - Create – Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered? 

 
# Characteristics of a good strategy
1. Focus
   - If the companies value curve lacks focus the business model will tend to be complex and cost structure will be high. 
2. Divergence
   - When it lacks divergence a companies strategy becomes a me-too with no reason to stand apart. 
3. Compelling tagline
   - When it lacks a compelling tagline that speaks to buyers, it is likely to internally driven or classic example of innovation for innovations sake. A good tagline must not only deliver a clear message but also an offering truth or else customers will lose trust and interest. 


 # Formulation of Blue Ocean Strategy:
- ***Reconstruct market boundaries:***
  - The more companies within an industry that share conventional wisdom the more they compete. 
  - Purchasers, users and influencers may overlap.  

 
- ***6 Paths to reconstruct market boundaries:***
  - Look across alternative industries.
  - Look across strategic groups within industries.
  - Look across chain of buyers.
  - Look across complementary product or service offerings.
  - Look across functional or emotional appeal to buyers.
  - Look across time.
 

- ***Focus on the big picture not the numbers:***
  - Visual awakening
  - Visual exploration
  - Visual strategy fair
  - Visual communication
 

- ***Reach beyond existing demand:***
  - Instead of concentrating on customers, need to look at non-customers.  
  - Instead of focusing on customer differences, need to focus on powerful commonalities in what buyers value.

# Three tiers of non-customers

- ![3 tiers of non-customers](./3-tiers-non-customers.png)

- First tier – sit on the edge of the market, they minimally purchase out of necessity but are mentally non-customers of industry. Jump in value would make them stay and purchase more frequently. 

- Second tier – Non-customers who refuse your industries offerings. Consciously choosing against industry ( better alternatives?) 

- Third tier – Never thought of your market as an option, by understanding key commonalities across these non-customers plus existing customers companies can pull these into the market. 

- Go for largest catchment possible, look across all 3 tiers, search for these commonalities.

# The Steps in the Buyer Cycle:
- Purchase 
- Delivery 
- Use 
- Supplements  
- Maintenance 
- Disposal 


# How to use Strategic Pricing: 
 

- **1st step.** Identify price corridor of the target mass: 

  - Different form, same function 
    - E.g. Model T ford replaced horses but had same function. 

  - Different form and function, same objective 
    - E.g. Cirque de soleil, same overall objective as entertainment. 


- **2nd step**. Pick a level within the price corridor: 

  - Upper level pricing – High degree of legal and resource protection 

  - Mid-level pricing – Some degree of legal and resource protection 

  - Lower-level pricing – Low degree / easy to imitate 

 

- ***Companies would be wise to follow mid to lower if the following apply:***
  - High fixed costs and marginal variable costs. 

  - The attractiveness of blue ocean depends heavily on network externalities. 

  - The cost structure behind blue ocean offering benefits from steep economies of scale and scope. 

  - In these cases volume brings significant cost advantages, something that makes pricing for volume more key.
