# Oliver

[![Jasper Ave redevelopment launched for Oliver area; input wanted - Edmonton | Globalnews.ca](https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.rKvd4LnPvlSiZXv7G9ei_AHaE8?cb=ucfimg2\&pid=Api\&ucfimg=1)](https://globalnews.ca/news/2360057/jasper-ave-redevelopment-launched-for-oliver-area-input-wanted/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Below is a **real-estate investor–focused** outline for **Oliver (Edmonton)** — now commonly branded as **Wîhkwêntôwin (formerly “Oliver”)** in many city planning contexts.

---

## 1) Nearby amenities & attractions (why tenants like it)

**Core “rentability” driver:** *Downtown-adjacent, walkable, transit-rich.*

* **Jasper Avenue corridor (109 St → 124 St)**: Edmonton’s main street feel, restaurants, retail, services; ongoing streetscape work (“Imagine Jasper Avenue”) improves walkability/streetscape over time.
* **124 Street / Brewery District**: shops, groceries, cafes, plus infill/mid-rise energy (strong for young professionals).
* **River Valley access** (nearby): quick access to trails/parks (a premium for downtown renters).
* **Downtown employment + post-secondary proximity**: ideal for renters who want short commutes.
* **LRT / major transit**: high share of transit and walk commuters shows the area’s mobility advantage (important for reducing tenant car-dependency). ([City of Edmonton][1])

**Investor takeaway:** Oliver behaves like a *“lifestyle rental node”* — demand tends to be resilient even when the city adds supply.

---

## 2) When homes were commonly built (stock age & renovation risk)

Oliver is *not* a single-era subdivision; it’s a long-evolving inner-city neighbourhood.

* Expect a large share of **older concrete high-rises + 1960s–1980s apartment stock**, plus **newer infill and newer luxury rentals/condos** scattered around Jasper Ave / key corridors.
* Practical implication: **big variance in condo fees, building envelope quality, special assessment risk** (due diligence is everything in this neighbourhood type).

*(No single “built year” dominates like a suburban community — the asset-quality dispersion is the story.)*

---

## 3) Common building types (what you’ll actually buy)

2014 municipal census (still directionally useful for housing form mix) shows Oliver is overwhelmingly apartment-based:

* **Apartment (5+ stories): ~66%**
* **Apartment (1–4 stories): ~30%**
* **Single detached / row / duplex/fourplex: tiny shares** ([City of Edmonton][1])

**Investor takeaway:** Oliver is primarily a **condo + purpose-built rental** market, not a “buy a house and suite it” market (unless you’re very targeted on a few pockets).

---

## 4) Zoning & whether it allows more units per lot

Because Oliver is inner-city, zoning is typically more permissive than suburban areas, and the neighbourhood has historically been planned for **medium/high density** along key corridors.

What this usually means in practice:

* **Corridor + node sites (esp. Jasper Ave / major streets)**: often allow **mid-rise / high-rise / mixed-use** redevelopment.
* **Interior pockets**: may still have smaller-scale residential zones, but even then, inner-city rules tend to allow **more infill forms** than many suburbs (subject to setbacks, height, FAR, parking rules, etc.).

**Action step (how investors verify quickly):**

* Use the City’s zoning map → confirm the **exact parcel zoning** and check allowable uses (multi-unit, mixed-use, etc.).
* If you’re pursuing “more units per lot,” target parcels already designated for **medium/high-density or mixed-use** rather than trying to rezone a low-scale interior lot.

*(I didn’t pull a parcel-by-parcel zoning breakdown in this pass; if you tell me a cross-street or a listing link, I can translate the exact zone into what you can build.)*

---

## 5) Population & population growth (demand base)

* **2019 Municipal Census population: 18,180** ([City of Edmonton][2])
* **2014 Municipal Census population: 19,135** ([City of Edmonton][1])

**Interpretation:** Over that window, Oliver looks **roughly flat to slightly down** (not explosive growth). In inner-city areas, population can be sensitive to:

* demolition/redevelopment timing,
* temporary vacancy during major projects,
* shifts between condo-ownership vs rental occupancy.

---

## 6) Average income in the area (tenant quality signal)

I wasn’t able to reliably extract a **neighbourhood-specific “average income” figure** from a primary City/StatsCan table within the tool limits in this run, so I’m not going to guess.

What I *can* say confidently based on the housing mix:

* With **very high renter share** and **high apartment concentration** ([City of Edmonton][1]), Oliver’s income profile is typically **mixed** (students/early-career renters + established professionals in higher-end towers).

If you want, I can produce an **income estimate with citations** by pulling the specific **federal census neighbourhood table** for Wîhkwêntôwin/Oliver in a follow-up.

---

## 7) Crime rate (risk, vacancy, and tenant-management reality)

You should assume Oliver has **higher downtown-style incident levels** than most suburban neighbourhoods.

Best source to quantify (by incident type and time window):

* **Edmonton Police Service Community Safety Data Portal / Neighbourhood Crime Mapping** ([Edmonton Police Service][3])
* City safety dashboards exist as well (good for trends). ([gis.edmonton.ca][4])

**Investor takeaway:** In Oliver, your edge comes from:

* building/tenant screening systems,
* solid property management,
* choosing blocks/buildings with better micro-location.

---

## 8) Rental supply/demand dynamics (what drives cashflow)

Oliver is *structurally renter-heavy*:

* **Rented units ~62.6%** (2014 municipal census) ([City of Edmonton][1])

So demand is **deep**, but supply is also **active** (lots of competing buildings).

**What this means for you:**

* Compete on **unit quality, in-suite laundry, parking, pet policy, and building amenities**.
* Expect tenants to “shop” hard: price sensitivity + lots of alternatives.

---

## 9) Average rents (neighbourhood + city context)

**Neighbourhood snapshot (listings-based):**

* RentFaster Oliver *1-bedroom* page shows many asking rents **around the mid-$1,400s+ range** (varies heavily by building age/amenities). ([RentFaster.ca][5])

**City benchmark (CMHC survey snapshot in a municipal highlights doc):**

* Edmonton City average rents (2024 survey snapshot): **Bachelor ~$1,051; 1-bed ~$1,218; 2-bed ~$1,513; 3+ ~$1,695**. ([City of St. Albert][6])

**Investor takeaway:** Oliver often rents **at/above city average** for comparable bedroom counts, but competition is intense — you win on “total package,” not just price.

---

## 10) Neighbourhood grade (A / B / C / D)

**My investor-grade for Oliver/Wîhkwêntôwin: *B- / C+*** (depends heavily on micro-block + building).

**Why not A:**

* Crime/incident risk higher than suburban family areas (management intensity). ([communitysafetydataportal.edmontonpolice.ca][7])
* Condo fee / special assessment risk can be meaningful in older towers.

**Why not D:**

* Strong amenities, walkability, employment adjacency, and persistent renter demand.

---

## 11) Long-term appreciation potential vs current returns/cashflow

**Typical pattern in dense inner-city condo-heavy areas:**

* **Cashflow can work** if you buy right (smaller units, good building, realistic fees, strong tenant profile).
* **Appreciation can lag** single-family land-constrained neighbourhoods *unless* you’re positioned in a building/micro-location that benefits from corridor upgrades and reinvestment.

A real bullish driver to watch:

* **Public realm investment on Jasper Ave** (streetscape, pedestrian upgrades) tends to support desirability over time.

**Practical expectation:** Oliver is often more of a **yield + stability play** than a “home-run appreciation” play (unless you’re doing redevelopment/infill where zoning supports it).

---

## 12) Average house prices (what you’ll pay)

Because Oliver is mostly apartments/condos, “average house price” can be misleading.

One neighbourhood market reference:

* HonestDoor shows an **Average “HonestDoor Price” for Oliver (Edmonton) ~ $758,794** (their blended stat across home types). ([HonestDoor][8])

**How investors should translate this:**

* Break your comps into **(1) condos**, **(2) purpose-built rental opportunities**, **(3) rare small multifamily / land assemblies** — don’t use one blended “average” to underwrite.

---

## 13) Strategies that can work well in Oliver (investor playbook)

### A) “High-occupancy, low-drama” condo rentals (best for limited time)

* Target **concrete buildings** with:

  * healthy reserve fund history,
  * stable condo fees (not artificially low),
  * no major known envelope/parking membrane issues,
  * strong rental demand features (laundry, parking, pet friendliness).
* Underwrite with **stress tests**: condo fee increases + special assessment reserve.

### B) “Furnished mid-term rental” (travel nurses / corporate / relocation)

* Works best near:

  * hospitals, downtown offices, transit.
* You’ll need tighter operations (turnovers, furnishing, insurance, bylaws/condo rules).

### C) Value-add on older units (cosmetic + layout)

* Because there’s a lot of older stock, a clean renovation can beat competing listings.
* Focus upgrades that actually move rent: flooring, lighting, kitchen refresh, in-suite laundry (if feasible), sound/privacy improvements.

### D) Infill / redevelopment (only on the right parcels)

* If you want “more units per lot,” your edge is:

  * buying sites already aligned with **medium/high density or mixed-use intent**,
  * assembling small lots,
  * riding corridor revitalization (Jasper Ave, etc.).

### E) Portfolio role (how Oliver fits a bigger plan)

* Oliver can be a **“cashflow anchor / renter-demand anchor”** while you pursue appreciation-heavy plays elsewhere (single-family land value, suite strategies, etc.).

# Ellerslie 

Here’s a comprehensive investor‑style neighborhood outline for Ellerslie in southeast Edmonton, based on the latest publicly available data (\~2019–2025):

---

## ✅ 1. Nearby amenities & attractions

* Several small parks and pathway networks throughout the community ([City of Edmonton][1])
* Nearby Summerside and Walker Park, local playgrounds, and the former Ellerslie Rugby Park (closed 2022) ([Wikipedia][2])
* Commercial nodes along Ellerslie Road and 91 Street provide grocery stores, banks, fast food, small restaurants, and proximity to South Edmonton and Windermere shopping areas ([AreaVibes][3])

---

## 🏗️ 2. When houses were built & common building types

* Community planned in early‑2000s; rapid residential development followed, mostly completed by mid‑2010s ([City of Edmonton][1])
* Building types: \~60–66% single‑family detached; \~20% row/semi‑detached/duplex; \~12–15% townhouses; low‑rise apartments \~5–12% ([Gimme-Shelter][4])

---

## 📐 3. Zoning and density (units per lot)

* Based on Edmonton’s Area Structure Plan and Neighbourhood Structure Plan, zoning supports low to medium density: R‑1 (single detached), R‑2/R‑3 (semi, duplex) and R TH / R AD for townhouses/apartments in specific nodes.
* Most lots are single‑detached; townhome/duplex zones allow multiple units per lot in designated blocks. Opportunities exist in re‑zoning older lots for infill, but majority built-out under original zoning plan ([City of Edmonton][1], [Wikipedia][5])

---

## 🧍 4. Population & growth

* 2012 municipal census: 5,566 residents, 5.7 % growth since 2009 ([Wikipedia][6])
* Broader Ellerslie area (including Orchards, Summerside) had \~8,400 residents by 2019 across \~3,000 dwellings (\~2.49 km²) ([Gimme-Shelter][4])

---

## 💰 5. Average income

* Median household income \~C\$106,400—\~12% above Alberta average, and \~29% above national average ([AreaVibes][3])

---

## 🚨 6. Crime rate

* Overall crime \~11% lower than Edmonton average; raw rate \~5,695 per 100,000 people—though Edmonton averages are high in national terms ([AreaVibes][3])

---

## 🏘️ 7. Rental supply & demand

* Current rental listings in Ellerslie (\~19–25 active units across types); mix of duplexes, townhouses, condos, basement suites, some single‑family rental houses ([RentFaster.ca][7])
* Demand seems modest but steady; many homeowners, but also families and professional renters nearby. Limited supply but data is partial.

---

## 💵 8. Average rents

According to RentFaster and Zumper:

* Duplexes: avg \~\$2,216 /mo (ranges \~\$2,100–2,300)
* Townhouses: avg \~\$1,746 /mo (\~1,525–1,850)
* Condos/apartments: \~\$1,573 /mo
* Basements: \~\$1,095–1,350 (\~avg \$1,222)
* Houses: \~\$2,275 for full single‑family rental ([RentFaster.ca][7])

---

## 🏙️ 9. A/B/C/D Neighborhood Grade

* Livability score \~66/100 (“Good”)
* Amenities score D (few local amenities), crime grade D, cost of living A, employment A+, housing A, but schools D+ ([AreaVibes][3])
* Overall this suggests a **B‑range** neighborhood: strong housing, income, safety; limited walkable retail/schools.

---

## 📊 10. House prices & appreciation potential

* Specific median sale price data not in public summary; market listed by some sources as “n/a” ([AreaVibes][3])
* Comparatively newer suburban southeast area, moderate‑to‑strong long‑term appeal tied to Windermere expansion, proximity to Anthony Henday, growing population.
* Likely price growth in line with Edmonton suburban avg (\~3–5% annually), with upside via infill or densification.

---

## 💡 11. Investment strategies

### ✅ A. Value-add / infill

* Acquire older single‑family on standard lots and apply for rezoning/infill (duplex, townhome) to increase density and cashflow.

### ✅ B. New-build rental or townhomes

* Develop small multi‑unit infill. New units in townhome form can command \$1,700–2,200+/mo.

### ✅ C. Long‑term hold (buy & hold single family)

* With median income and low vacancy rates, rent well. Stable moderate cashflow if leveraged.

### ✅ D. BRRRR strategy on basement suites

* Purchase single-family, add legal basement rental suite; collect basement rent (\~\$1,200) while long-term tenants upstairs.

### ✅ E. Multi-family rental block

* Invest in or develop low-rise apartment units in designated zones near transit corridors or commercial nodes.

* Obtain City of Edmonton zoning maps and property-specific zoning to evaluate infill permissions.
* Review transit access (future LRT plans) and commercial development pipeline in Ellerslie and Windermere.
* Survey vacancy & rent listings over three months to validate demand.

# Grovenor

Here’s a comprehensive investor‑style overview of **Grovenor**, a mature neighbourhood in west Edmonton, based on up‑to‑date data into mid‑2025:

---

## 🏙️ 1. Nearby amenities & attractions

* Commercial services and shops are concentrated along **Stony Plain Road** and **149 Street**, including cafes, restaurants, small clinics and boutique retail ([City of Edmonton][1]).
* Nearby major attractions include Telus World of Science, Heritage Amphitheatre, Earth Sciences Museum, Clare Drake Arena — accessible within minutes to the east ([AreaVibes][2]).

---

## 🏗️ 2. Housing age & development timeline

* Initial residential development began around **1907–1910**, with many early homes built pre‑WWII, around **18% by 1945**; most construction was completed by **1980** ([Wikipedia][3]).

---

## 🏡 3. Common building types

* Predominantly **single‑detached homes (\~88%)**, with **duplexes (\~9%)** and **row houses (\~3%)**; almost 77% owner‑occupied, remainder rented ([Wikipedia][3]).

---

## 📐 4. Zoning and density opportunities

* As a **mature area**, Grovenor is zoned for low‑density residential (single detached, duplex, low‑rise infill). Existing duplexes and low‑rise apartments reflect mid‑century in‑fill ([City of Edmonton][1]).
* Rezoning older parcels for duplex or multi‑unit infill is possible, especially where redevelopment is allowed under the City’s Mature Neighbourhood Overlay.

---

## 👥 5. Population & growth

* According to Edmonton’s municipal census:
  **2,362 residents** in **2012**, representing a **12% growth** from 2009, at **2,567 people/km²** in a **0.92 km²** area ([Wikipedia][3]).
* More recent data (mid‑2025) estimates population around **2,231**—a slight decline or estimate variance; household mix: \~35% single persons, 58% families, 65% owners vs 35% renters ([Wahi][4]).

---

## 💰 6. Average household income

* **Median household income** around **C\$104,000**, \~10% above Alberta average ([AreaVibes][2]).
* Another source estimates **average household income \~C\$146,800**, reflecting likely newer or higher‑earning households as of mid‑2025 ([Wahi][4]).

---

## 🚨 7. Crime rate

* Estimated **total crime rate \~5,049 per 100,000**, around **20% higher than Canada average**, but still **\~20% below Alberta average** ([AreaVibes][2]).
* Violent crime slightly lower than national average; chance of any crime \~**1 in 20** annually ([AreaVibes][5]).

---

## 🏘️ 8. Rental supply & demand

* Active rental listings remain limited: only a handful of apartments, basement units and townhouse rentals visible (e.g. 4 on Zillow) ([Zillow][6]).
* Demand seems steady for small units given proximity to the core and ravine access; limited rental stock supports moderate demand.

---

## 💵 9. Average rents

* Zumper average rent overall \~**C\$1,465/month**:

  * 1‑bed: \~\$1,094
  * 2‑bed: \~\$1,600
  * 3‑bed: \~\$2,299/month ([Zumper - Apartments for Rent & Houses][7]).
* HonestDoor estimates average rent \~**C\$2,668** (likely including houses/condos) as of July 2025 ([HonestDoor][8]).

---

## 🏘️ 10. Neighborhood Grade (A/B/C/D)

* Livability rated \~86/100, strong on amenities, housing, employment; **crime gets D+, cost of living B**, overall housing A‑, schools and safety rated A+ by Areavibes also ([AreaVibes][9]).
* Overall this positions Grovenor as a **strong B‑grade to low‑A neighbourhood**: established, mature, safe with slightly above average income and housing value.

---

## 📈 11. Average house prices & appreciation potential

* Recent median sale price in 2021–22: **\~C\$400,000** (e.g. \~1,000 sq ft bungalow built in 1955) with individual sales from \~C\$250k to C\$1.15M ([Schmidt Realty Group][10]).
* HonestDoor 2025 average price \~**C\$553,000**, down \~1.8% from previous month, with \~\$428/sq ft sale rate ([HonestDoor][8]).
* Appreciation: Properties in Grovenor typically steady long‑term growth, buoyed by mature location, infill potential, and core‑area attraction; modest rental yields vs appreciation from price growth.

---

## 🧰 12. Investment strategies that fit Grovenor

### ✅ A. Infill / Build-Down

* Convert older single‑family homes by adding **legal basement suites** or secondary units for rental income.

### ✅ B. Duplex / Triplex redevelopment

* Acquire aging homes and subdivide or redevelop into **duplex or small muti‑unit** under mature neighbourhood guidelines—subject to zoning and overlay approvals.

### ✅ C. Buy‑and‑hold single-family

* Higher‑income neighbourhood supports stable rental income (\~C\$2.6k for condos; lower for apartments). Good long‑term appreciation, modest cap rate.

### ✅ D. Small-scale condos or townhomes

* Target infill parcels or redevelopment along Stony Plain Road corridors for low‑rise multi‑unit projects targeting professionals.

### ✅ E. Renovate and flip

* Due to mix of older dwellings, cosmetic renovation and modernization can yield returns, especially if resale targets >C\$550k.

* Additional construction occurred through the **1980s (\~19%)** and **1990s (\~13%)**, making it a largely mature residential area with most homes built by 1999 ([Wikipedia][1]).

---

## 🏡 3. Common Building Types

* As per 2005 data: about **50% single‑detached houses**, **36% row houses**, **9–10% low-rise apartments**, and **\~5% duplex/triplex** units ([censusdocs.edmonton.ca][3]).
* Owner-occupancy stands at around **72%**, with **28% rental units** ([Wikipedia][1]).

---

## 📐 4. Zoning & Density Potential

* Planned under the **Belmead Neighbourhood Structure Plan (1981 ASP)** with emphasis on **efficient higher density** vs surroundings, especially clustering multi-unit structures near transit corridors ([City of Edmonton][2]).
* Predominantly low to medium density zoning (single detached, row housing, low-rise apartments); potential exists for **infill redevelopment** or multi‑unit conversions in specific zones, subject to City overlay rules.

---

## 👥 5. Population & Growth

* 2012 municipal census recorded **4,603 residents** in 1.28 km² — at **\~3,596 per km²**, representing \~2.6% growth since 2009 ([Wikipedia][1]).
* The 2019 estimate shows **\~3,810 residents** across \~1,450 dwellings (some variation in data sets) ([Gimme-Shelter][4]).
* Broadly stable population, moderate turnover — typical mobility with \~10% moving in last year, \~18% in past 3 years ([BeechWoolger][5]).

---

## 💰 6. Average Household Income

* Median household income \~**C\$83,500** (about 12% below Alberta average, slightly above national average) ([AreaVibes][6]).

---

## 🚨 7. Crime Rate

* Personal risk estimated at **1 in 15 chance** of being a victim annually ([AreaVibes][7]).

---

## 🏘️ 8. Rental Supply & Demand

* Rental listings include a selection of apartments and row‑houses; Zumper lists about **25 active listings** (mostly 2‑3 bed units) ([Zumper - Apartments for Rent & Houses][8]).
* Demand steady but moderate—supportive of affordable workers/families rather than premium segments; rental supply adequate for this demographic.

---

## 💵 9. Average Rents

* Average rent for **3-bedroom apartments** about **C\$1,396/month** ([Zumper - Apartments for Rent & Houses][8]).
* Smaller units (1–2 bed) likely range from **C\$1,000–1,300/month**, consistent with broader west‑end Edmonton pricing.

---

## 🏅 10. Neighborhood Grade

* **Livability score: 83/100 (considered exceptional)** ([HonestDoor][9], [AreaVibes][6]).
* Housing described as “very affordable with above average appreciation potential” ([AreaVibes][10]).
* However **crime is a weakness**, rated F-crime in Areavibes data. Cost of living is low (A), employment B, overall housing affordability good.
* **Grade: B‑range** — affordable and family-oriented, but with elevated crime relative to city.

---

## 🏠 11. Average House Prices & Appreciation Potential

* As of **July 2025**, **12 active listings**, **average asking price \~C\$383,700**, mean listing price \~\$283/sq ft across \~1,271 sq ft homes ([AreaVibes][10], [edmontonhomes.ca][11]).
* Sale prices span **\~C\$110k to \$700k**, reflecting mix of condos, row-houses and detached homes ([edmontonhomes.ca][11]).
* Historically appreciation is steady and moderate, with **higher potential upside via row-house or townhouse conversions**.
* Good **cash flow potential** due to lower purchase prices and affordable rents yielding reasonable cap rates for investors.

---

## 🧰 12. Investment Strategies

### A. Buy‑and‑Hold Detached or Row-Houses

* Affordable entry (mid‑\$300k), stable rental return (approx. **\$1,300–1,400/mo** for 3-bed units) offers moderately positive cash flow.

### B. BRRRR or Legal Basement Suites

* Buying a detached or row‐home, renovating and adding a legal basement suite can boost rental income and value.

### C. Small Multi‑unit or Townhouse Redevelopment

* Under NSP and zoning, possible to acquire older units and redevelop into row housing or low-rise townhouses to increase density and yield.

### D. Entry-level Rentals Targeting Young Families/Professionals

* With average income below city average, lower‑cost 2‑3 bedroom rentals appeal to middle-income households, students, and entry workers.

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

1. Pull **current MLS sales & rent comparables** (2023–25) for updated price per housing type.
2. Download **Belmead Neighbourhood Structure Plan & zoning maps** to explore redevelopment allowance and infill density.
3. Assess local **crime mapping** via Edmonton Police Service for trends and hotspots.
4. Track rental vacancy & average rent trends via CMHC or rental platforms over recent 12 months.

---

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

Belmead is a **value-oriented, family-friendly neighbourhood** with strong occupancy, affordable housing, and solid rental demand. While crime is elevated relative to city norms, residents benefit from close proximity to West Edmonton Mall, convenient transit routes, and a built environment supportive of **infill redevelopment and density upgrades**. For investors: good opportunity for **cash flow entry**, value‑add via **suite conversions or row-house infill**, and potential for moderate appreciation tied to mature west‑Edmonton growth dynamics.

---

## 🏡 3. Common Building Types

---

## 👥 5. Population & Growth

### ✅ B. BRRRR with Basement Suites

* Legal suites in bungalows can raise total rent income, improving return in lower-priced homes.

### ✅ C. Small Infill or Row-House Redevelopment

* Opportunities where row housing allowed; limited scale but could densify pockets within zoning provisions.

### ✅ D. Acquire & Renovate Value Properties

* Cosmetic upgrades or modest renovation of aging apartments or townhomes could extract value for resale or rent bump.

---

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

Kilkenny presents a **budget-friendly entry point** for investors targeting stable rents and modest returns. While crime rates and below-average income dampen appeal, the low property prices combined with demand for affordable family housing create **cash-flow opportunities**. Best suited for investors interested in **value-add via suites or renovations**, or **long-term hold** in an affordable mature area with limited appreciation potential.

  * Listings average pricing \~\$150–180 K (per listings), price per sqft \~\$179–286 depending on data source ([edmontonrealestate.ca][13], [HonestDoor][14]).
  * HonestDoor reports average sale price \~\$366,800; sold price per sqft \~\$286 ([HonestDoor][14]).
  * AreaVibes median for Edmonton is \~\$370K, while Belvedere likely below that ([AreaVibes][9]).
* **Returns/Cashflow**: average rents (~~\$1,335) vs property cost (~~\$180–370 K) suggests gross rental yield \~4‑8%, modest cashflow depending on financing and expenses.

**Long‑term potential**:

* Proximity to LRT and mature area redevelopment could support value appreciation. However, elevated crime and lower income limit demand from owner‑occupiers. Appreciation upside may hinge on targeted improvement, infill redevelopment, or converting low‑rise to multiplex units.

---

## 11. Investment Strategies That Could Work

1. **Small multi‑suite income properties**: Acquire older homes and add secondary suites (permitted) to boost yield.
2. **Low‑rise redevelopment or multiplex builds**: Under R‑zoning if permitted, subdividing or building duplex/triplex can increase units.
3. **Buy-and-hold rental**: Affordable entry point, stable rental demand; focus on landlords comfortable managing older stock.
4. **Value-add flips or renovations**: Improve curb appeal, safety, rentability to attract better tenants or resale buyers.
5. **Transit-oriented rental strategy**: Marketing to students and commuters using LRT access.

---

### Recommendations

* **Due diligence**: Confirm current zoning maps (City of Edmonton zoning: RPL, RSL, etc.) and development bylaws to see if more units per lot allowed.
* **Site visits**: Evaluate safety, tenancy, condition, and surrounding investments.
* **Target property types**: Multi‑suite homes or buildings ripe for infill redevelopment.
* **Exit strategy**: Consider hold long‑term for rental income or flip after renovations.
* **Mitigate risks**: Criminal activity and lower-income demographics mean tenant screening, security, and property maintenance are vital.

Belvedere offers **very affordable entry point** with good transit connectivity and a mix of rental occupants—but it carries **elevated crime and modest growth**. For investors with experience in managing older or lower‑income rental stock and pursuing infill or small multiplex redevelopment, it can offer cashflow and moderate appreciation upside over time.

# Kildare

Here's a detailed outline and analysis of Kildare, a mature northeast Edmonton neighbourhood in the Londonderry area:

---

## 1. Nearby Amenities & Attractions 🏬

* **Londonderry Mall** sits within Kildare at 66 Street & 137–144 Avenue, offering major retail, services & dining ([Wikipedia][1]).
* **Londonderry Athletic Grounds**, with sports fields, running track & fitness centre, lie adjacent and serve the community broadly ([Wikipedia][1]).
* **Parks within Kildare** include Kildare Park and Cherrydale Park, which feature playgrounds, fields and gathering spaces ([Wikipedia][1]).
* Nearby transit access is solid, supporting walkability, biking and transit commutes ([Local Logic][2]).

---

## 2. When were houses commonly built?

* Majority of residential development occurred in the **1960s through the 1980s/early 1990s** ([City of Edmonton][3]).

---

## 3. Common Building Types

* Around **60% are single-detached homes**. The remaining \~40% comprises **row houses, low-rise apartments and duplexes** ([Gimme-Shelter][4]).

---

## 4. Zoning Regulations & Unit Multiplicity

* Edmonton’s Zoning Bylaw 20001 (effective Jan 1, 2024) introduces the **RS Zone** allowing up to **8 dwelling units per lot** by default depending on lot area and configuration ([Storeys][5]).
* Under the RS Zone, a **minimum 225 m² lot supports at least 3 units**; a **600 m² lot allows up to 8 units** including basement suites, row housing or multiplexes ([Situate Inc.][6]).
* Proposed council debate (June 2025) aims to possibly reduce the maximum to **6 units per mid‑block lot**, but as of now the eight-unit cap is still in effect ([Taproot Edmonton][7]).

---

## 5. Population & Growth

* In 2012, the population was **2,763 living in 1,209 dwellings**, a **–4.3% decline** since 2009 ([Wikipedia][8]).
* More recent growth: the greater Londonderry area (Kildare + Kilkenny) may have seen modest recovery; Kildare is not listed as high‑growth.
* HonestDoor reports **+7.14% average price growth year-over-year** (likely correlated to modest demand) but not direct population growth data ([Wikipedia][1], [HonestDoor][9]).

---

## 6. Average Household Income

* Specific Kildare income stats unavailable; neighboring York had average household income around **\$53,200 (2001)** vs Edmonton average \$57,360 at that time ([Wikipedia][10]).
* Given demographic similarities, **Kildare income is likely at or slightly below Edmonton average**.

---

## 7. Crime Rate

* Kildare’s crime rate is reported as approximately **93% higher than the Canadian average**, with violent crime around **50% above average**, and a **1-in-13 chance** of victimization. It's safer than only \~24% of Alberta neighbourhoods ([AreaVibes][11]).

---

## 8. Rental Supply & Demand

* Rental turnover is moderate: about **40% renter-occupied units** in community ([Gimme-Shelter][4]).
* Some townhomes and apartments available: only around **1–2 current rentals online** in Kildare specifically, showing **limited supply** and stable demand ([Zillow][12]).

---

## 9. Average Rents

* A current **townhouse rental for 2 bed / 2 bath** was listed at approximately **C\$1,365/mo** ([Zillow][12]).
* Other listings in surrounding areas ranged **C\$1,200–1,900 per month** depending on bedroom count.

---

## 10. Neighborhood Grade (A/B/C/D)

* Kildare is a **mature, working-to-middle income community** with aging stock, moderate income and elevated crime.
* It likely falls into a **“C” grade neighborhood**, with some potential upside but also limitations.

---

## 11. Long-term Appreciation vs Cash‑Flow

* The average property price is around **C\$269,000 (HonestDoor)**, with listed active homes averaging **C\$310,000**, and an average of **C\$279/sqft** ([HonestDoor][9], [AreaVibes][11], [Reddit][13], [edmontonrealestate.ca][14]).
* Year-over-year growth \~7 % indicates modest appreciation. With average rents at approx **\$1,400/month**, gross rents are about < 6% yield on typical prices—thin positive cash flow.
* Appreciation appears stronger than cash flow, making it more drift toward **value-growth/revitalization play**, not high-yield.

---

## 12. Average House Prices

* **HonestDoor average property price:** \~**C\$269,210** ([HonestDoor][9]).
* **Current active listings average:** \~**C\$309,800** (range \$130k to \$450k) ([Wahi][15]).

---

## 13. Investment Strategies That Could Work

* **Missing‑Middle Infill Strategy**: Given RS zoning allows 3–8 units per lot, a duplex or row‑house infill with secondary suites could boost net operating income.
* **Renovation & Hold**: Purchase older single-detached homes at lower cost, renovate and hold for moderate rent and capital growth.
* **Condoconversion**: As some multiplexes can be condominiumized over time, converting to condos could allow resale exit strategies ([Storeys][5], [Reddit][13]).
* **Buy & Rent to Own/GRSP**: Mid‑market affordability attracts renter‑families; offering rent‑to‑own may attract stable tenants.
* **Focus on turn‑key row‑house units** for reliable tenancy and tighter maintenance.

### ✅ Final Thoughts

Kildare is a mature, affordable neighborhood with solid transit, retail, and sports amenities. It offers opportunity for **infill/missing-middle development**, but crime and aging housing stock remain challenges. It's best suited for investors seeking **moderate appreciation and slow, steady rental income**, rather than high‑yield cash‑flow plays. Tight evaluation of acquisition cost, financing, and renovation/infill potential is crucial to success.
