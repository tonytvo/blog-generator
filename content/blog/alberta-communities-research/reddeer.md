* **Community Life**: Community association actively runs events and collaborates with schools and police to support neighbourhood watch and safety programs ([Chris Strong Realtor][3]).

---

## 🏡 2. Housing Age & Styles

* **Common types**: Mostly single‑detached homes (\~52% of dwellings in Anders South/Aspen Ridge), followed by apartments (\~12%), townhouses (\~0.4%) and duplex/semi‑detached (\~3.5%) ([City of Red Deer][5]).

---

## 📊 3. Zoning & Density

* Zoning is primarily R‑1 single‑family residential. Most lots are single‑family units; secondary suites may be allowed under city accessory suite policies.

* Expect modest growth since, consistent with infill rather than expansion.

---

* Contrast to general warnings about Red Deer overall from anecdotal reports — Anders South remains an outlier in safety ([Reddit][7]).

---

* Rental supply is modest — primarily in secondary suites or boarder situations; formal multi‑unit product limited. Demand is steady from young professionals or families attracted to safety and schools.
* Average rents in Red Deer roughly A‑frame (two‑bedroom apartments) range CAD 1,200–1,400; for single‑family home lease around CAD 1,800–2,200 per month depending on size and finish.

---

## 🔮 10. Appreciation vs Cash Flow

* Long‑term potential: modest home price growth in Red Deer market (around +7% YoY, slowing to <1% monthly) ([Big John][10]).
* High upfront investment in Anders South means capital appreciation strapped to city growth.
* Cash‑flow outlook is moderate: rental yields lower in single‑family in mature zone; however low vacancy and stable demand lend to consistent cash flow. Total returns hinge more on price appreciation than rental yield.

---

## 🧠 11. Investment Strategies That May Work

1. **Buy & Hold Single‑Family for Cash Flow**: Secondary suite or legal accessory suite improves yield.
2. **Renovation Flip**: Mid‑price home rehab for resale to premium‑income households.
3. **Infill/Re‑subdivision**: On large lots, apply for subdivision or duplex zoning if permitted.
4. **Niche Rental**: Lease high‑end executive family homes to professionals – premium rent segment.
5. **Long‑term Value Appreciation**: Hold in stable neighbourhood expecting steady price growth even if slower than major metro.

---

## 📍 Overview & Amenities

* A modern planned neighbourhood in northeast Red Deer, anchored by **Clearview Market Square**, parks, multi-use pathways, wetlands, a small man‑made lake with spray park, playgrounds, rink, and proximity to Red Deer River Valley trails ([melcor.ca][1]).

---

## ⚖️ Zoning & Lot Utilization

* Zoning allows primarily **R‑1 and R‑1A residential lots**, meaning one dwelling per lot. Small multi‑unit townhouse developments occur near the mixed‑use centre. There is **no general high‑density zoning** for multiple units per typical single‑family lot.

---

## 👥 Demographics, Income & Growth

* The City of Red Deer had \~100,844 residents in 2021, up modestly from \~100,418 in 2016 — growth less than 1% over five years, but more recent municipal estimates in 2019 reached \~101,002 ([Wikipedia][4]).
* Local demographic data specific to Clearview Ridge is limited, but it is characterized as a **family‑oriented** area with access to schools and daycares ([Local Logic][5]).
* Average household income: exact stats aren’t publicly available, but cost of living noted \~3% above city average, implying moderately higher median incomes relative to the Red Deer average ([Andrew Russell & Associates][6]).

---

## 🔒 Crime Profile

* Crime in Clearview Ridge is about **34% lower than the citywide average** ([AreaVibes][7]).
* Confirmed as one of the safer neighbourhoods by local perspectives ([Andrew Russell & Associates][6]).

---

## 🏘️ Rental Market & Pricing

* Rental supply/demand specifics for Clearview Ridge are scarce. But in Red Deer generally, **townhouses and single‑family homes** are in demand among families.
* Available townhouse listings: **C\$310 K–322 K** (approx. 2‑3 beds) ([Andrew Russell & Associates][6]). House listings range **C\$419 K–C\$854 K**, sizes 1,100–2,000 sq ft ([Zillow][8]).
* **Average house price** across listing sample is around **C\$578,000** ([Shantel Campbell][9]).
* Average rent levels in Red Deer vary; though specific rental speed in Clearview Ridge isn’t reported, comparable-built townhomes likely rent in the **C\$1,500–2,200/month** range, depending on layout and finish.

---

## 🏠 Neighborhood Quality (A/B/C/D)

* In investor grading terms, Clearview Ridge would likely be **A–/B+**: desirable, low-crime, newer builds, family-friendly amenities, but not ultra-high-end.

---

## 📈 Appreciation & Cash‑Flow Potential

* Homes are fairly new, so short‑term appreciation may be moderate. Carrying cost and modest price growth in Red Deer suggest **steady but not explosive** capital gains.
* Given relatively lower purchase prices (\~mid‑C\$500 K), strong rental yield potential exists if rentals rent well. Townhouse or small detached rental may achieve \~5–6% gross yield, depending on mortgage and expenses.
* Long-term, appreciation tied to Red Deer’s modest growth; infrastructure addition or densification near transit could lift value.

---

## 💡 Investment Strategies

1. **Buy a newer single‑family home** (\~C\$550 K–600 K), and rent to families—low capex, stable tenants.
2. **Acquire a townhouse** (\~C\$310 K–\~C\$350 K), especially close to market square, for higher yield and ease of turnover.
3. **Buy and hold**, expecting modest appreciation plus positive cash flow.
4. **Renovate and resell**: less scope because most homes are new, but cosmetic upgrades may support resale at top‑end prices.
5. **Group of investors**: develop small multi‑unit rental near commercial centre if allowed by zoning permissions.
