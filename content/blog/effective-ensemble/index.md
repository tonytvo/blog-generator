# 7 habits of highly effective mobber

- Inspired by *Turn the Ship Around!* by L. David Marquet, a book that applies leadership and responsibility principles in real-world contexts.  
  - Covey's habit serves as a foundation for improving teamwork and fostering agility.  


## **Proactiveness in Mob Programming**

### **2. Contextual Foundation**
- Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick explore the principle of "Be Proactive" from *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* by Stephen Covey.  
  - Objective: Relate this principle to mob programming and software development practices.

- **Background on the Book and Habit:**  
  - Covey emphasizes self-determination and the freedom to choose one’s response to external stimuli.  
  - "Proactive people focus on what they can do and influence, rather than what they cannot control."  

**Examples from Life:**  
  - *Negative Situations:*  
    - Prisoners in a war camp finding ways to maintain hope and dignity.  
    - Software developers assigned a repetitive, frustrating task choosing to streamline it through automation instead of complaining.  
  - *Positive Situations Gone Wrong:*  
    - Someone in a supportive environment still finds dissatisfaction because of a reactive mindset, leading to missed opportunities.  

**Example in Software:** A team faced with a chaotic legacy system might either complain about its complexity (reactive) or start identifying areas for incremental refactoring (proactive).

### **Proactiveness in Mob Programming**
- **Definition and Clarification:**  
  - Proactiveness isn’t about merely “working harder” or preparing extensively. It’s about actively influencing situations and choosing responses.  
- **Why It Works in Mob Programming:**  
  - In mob programming, multiple perspectives can challenge a reactive mindset.  
  - Collaboration fosters a culture where small, proactive actions (e.g., suggesting improvements during a discussion) ripple through the team.  

**Example in Mob Programming:**  
  - A team encountering a recurring bug doesn’t just fix it repeatedly. Instead, they collectively brainstorm a long-term solution, such as creating automated tests to catch the issue earlier.


### **Real-World Examples in Development Teams**
- **Solo Development vs. Mob Development:**  
  - Solo developers might feel stuck in “reactive” roles, focusing only on assigned tasks (e.g., fixing bugs or handling tickets).  
  - In mob development, a proactive team member can guide others toward innovative solutions or improvements.  

**Scenario 1:**  
  - A junior developer is tasked with resolving bugs in a legacy system.  
  - Reactive approach: Fix the bug, move to the next ticket, and complain about outdated code.  
  - Proactive approach: Analyze the root cause, suggest improvements to reduce future bugs, and advocate for modernization efforts in team meetings.  

**Scenario 2:**  
  - A team relies on a cumbersome ticketing system that slows down collaboration with another team.  
  - Reactive: Accept the inefficiency and blame the system.  
  - Proactive: One member walks over to the other team’s space, initiates direct communication, and finds faster ways to resolve issues.

### **Psychological and Practical Impacts**
- **Therapeutic Effects of Proactiveness:**  
  - Empowering individuals to focus on what they can control reduces stress and creates a sense of accomplishment.  
- **Expanding the Circle of Influence:**  
  - By focusing on actionable changes, individuals and teams build momentum, leading to broader, systemic improvements.  

**Examples in Mob Programming:**  
  - **Therapeutic Impact:** A developer overwhelmed by the volume of issues might focus on automating a single tedious task. This small win improves their morale and motivates further action.  

- **Circle of Influence:** A team automates repetitive deployment steps, freeing up time to tackle higher-level challenges.

### **Indicators of a Proactive Team**
- **Symptoms of a Reactive Team:**  
  - Retrospectives focus on trivial issues (e.g., changing coffee brands in the break room).  
  - Problems persist because no one believes in their ability to effect change.  
- **Proactive Retrospectives:**  
  - Address critical challenges, such as system reliability, team communication, or process inefficiencies.  

**Example of Proactive Symptom Identification:**  
  - A team realizes their build pipeline is too slow.  
  - Instead of accepting it as “just the way it is,” they investigate bottlenecks and schedule work to optimize the pipeline.

### **Individual Proactiveness in Mobs**
- **Scaling Influence:**  
  - Begin with small, actionable steps within your control.  
- **Handling Resistance:**  
  - Proactive behavior includes resilience in the face of negative responses.  
  - Rather than getting discouraged by team rejection of ideas, focus on refining and reintroducing them later.  

**Examples in Mob Programming:**  
  - A mob observes inefficiency in their manual database processes.  
  - Reactive: Continue using manual steps and complain about the time wasted.  
  - Proactive: One member introduces a learning session to teach automation techniques, gradually leading the team toward fully automated workflows.

### **Long-Term Impact**
- **Virtuous Loops in Retrospectives:**  
  - Continuous reflection and action amplify growth and innovation over time.  
  - Teams reach new levels of efficiency by breaking through previously perceived limits.  

- **Butterfly Effect of Small Actions:**  
  - Minor changes (e.g., introducing a single automation script) cascade into significant improvements.  

**Example:**  
  - A team begins by automating a simple task like error reporting.  
  - This sparks interest in automating related processes, ultimately leading to a fully automated CI/CD pipeline.

### **Closing Thoughts**
- **Key Takeaways:**  
  - Proactivity is foundational for teamwork, mob programming, and personal growth.  
  - Focusing on what you can influence fosters resilience, innovation, and a positive team culture.  
- **Practical Advice:**  
  - Start small: Identify one area where you can make a difference today.  
  - Encourage a proactive mindset in your team by modeling the behavior and celebrating small wins.
