# 7 habits of highly effective mobber

- Inspired by *Turn the Ship Around!* by L. David Marquet, a book that applies leadership and responsibility principles in real-world contexts.  
  - Covey's habit serves as a foundation for improving teamwork and fostering agility.  


## **Proactiveness in Mob Programming**

### **2. Contextual Foundation**
- Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick explore the principle of "Be Proactive" from *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* by Stephen Covey.  
  - Objective: Relate this principle to mob programming and software development practices.

- **Background on the Book and Habit:**  
  - Covey emphasizes self-determination and the freedom to choose one’s response to external stimuli.  
  - "Proactive people focus on what they can do and influence, rather than what they cannot control."  

**Examples from Life:**  
  - *Negative Situations:*  
    - Prisoners in a war camp finding ways to maintain hope and dignity.  
    - Software developers assigned a repetitive, frustrating task choosing to streamline it through automation instead of complaining.  
  - *Positive Situations Gone Wrong:*  
    - Someone in a supportive environment still finds dissatisfaction because of a reactive mindset, leading to missed opportunities.  

**Example in Software:** A team faced with a chaotic legacy system might either complain about its complexity (reactive) or start identifying areas for incremental refactoring (proactive).

---

### **Proactiveness in Mob Programming**
- **Definition and Clarification:**  
  - Proactiveness isn’t about merely “working harder” or preparing extensively. It’s about actively influencing situations and choosing responses.  
- **Why It Works in Mob Programming:**  
  - In mob programming, multiple perspectives can challenge a reactive mindset.  
  - Collaboration fosters a culture where small, proactive actions (e.g., suggesting improvements during a discussion) ripple through the team.  

**Example in Mob Programming:**  
  - A team encountering a recurring bug doesn’t just fix it repeatedly. Instead, they collectively brainstorm a long-term solution, such as creating automated tests to catch the issue earlier.


### **Real-World Examples in Development Teams**
- **Solo Development vs. Mob Development:**  
  - Solo developers might feel stuck in “reactive” roles, focusing only on assigned tasks (e.g., fixing bugs or handling tickets).  
  - In mob development, a proactive team member can guide others toward innovative solutions or improvements.  

**Scenario 1:**  
  - A junior developer is tasked with resolving bugs in a legacy system.  
  - Reactive approach: Fix the bug, move to the next ticket, and complain about outdated code.  
  - Proactive approach: Analyze the root cause, suggest improvements to reduce future bugs, and advocate for modernization efforts in team meetings.  

**Scenario 2:**  
  - A team relies on a cumbersome ticketing system that slows down collaboration with another team.  
  - Reactive: Accept the inefficiency and blame the system.  
  - Proactive: One member walks over to the other team’s space, initiates direct communication, and finds faster ways to resolve issues.

---

### **Psychological and Practical Impacts**
- **Therapeutic Effects of Proactiveness:**  
  - Empowering individuals to focus on what they can control reduces stress and creates a sense of accomplishment.  
- **Expanding the Circle of Influence:**  
  - By focusing on actionable changes, individuals and teams build momentum, leading to broader, systemic improvements.  

**Examples in Mob Programming:**  
  - **Therapeutic Impact:** A developer overwhelmed by the volume of issues might focus on automating a single tedious task. This small win improves their morale and motivates further action.  

- **Circle of Influence:** A team automates repetitive deployment steps, freeing up time to tackle higher-level challenges.

---

### **Indicators of a Proactive Team**
- **Symptoms of a Reactive Team:**  
  - Retrospectives focus on trivial issues (e.g., changing coffee brands in the break room).  
  - Problems persist because no one believes in their ability to effect change.  
- **Proactive Retrospectives:**  
  - Address critical challenges, such as system reliability, team communication, or process inefficiencies.  

**Example of Proactive Symptom Identification:**  
  - A team realizes their build pipeline is too slow.  
  - Instead of accepting it as “just the way it is,” they investigate bottlenecks and schedule work to optimize the pipeline.

---

### **Individual Proactiveness in Mobs**
- **Scaling Influence:**  
  - Begin with small, actionable steps within your control.  
- **Handling Resistance:**  
  - Proactive behavior includes resilience in the face of negative responses.  
  - Rather than getting discouraged by team rejection of ideas, focus on refining and reintroducing them later.  

**Examples in Mob Programming:**  
  - A mob observes inefficiency in their manual database processes.  
  - Reactive: Continue using manual steps and complain about the time wasted.  
  - Proactive: One member introduces a learning session to teach automation techniques, gradually leading the team toward fully automated workflows.

---

### **Long-Term Impact**
- **Virtuous Loops in Retrospectives:**  
  - Continuous reflection and action amplify growth and innovation over time.  
  - Teams reach new levels of efficiency by breaking through previously perceived limits.  

- **Butterfly Effect of Small Actions:**  
  - Minor changes (e.g., introducing a single automation script) cascade into significant improvements.  

**Example:**  
  - A team begins by automating a simple task like error reporting.  
  - This sparks interest in automating related processes, ultimately leading to a fully automated CI/CD pipeline.

---

### **Closing Thoughts**
- **Key Takeaways:**  
  - Proactivity is foundational for teamwork, mob programming, and personal growth.  
  - Focusing on what you can influence fosters resilience, innovation, and a positive team culture.  
- **Practical Advice:**  
  - Start small: Identify one area where you can make a difference today.  
  - Encourage a proactive mindset in your team by modeling the behavior and celebrating small wins.

## **Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind**

### **Introduction: Context and Framework**
#### Key Premises:
1. **Habit Discussed**:
   - *Begin with the End in Mind* from Stephen Covey’s *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*.
   - This habit emphasizes clarity of purpose and vision, both individually and collectively, before undertaking a task.
2. **Application to Mob Programming**:
   - Mob programming amplifies team dynamics and collaboration.
   - Collective alignment on the “end” becomes crucial for sustainable, high-quality development.

#### **Why This Matters in Software Development**:
- Misaligned goals in software engineering lead to inefficiencies:
  - Example: Teams refactoring without clear direction may create over-engineered or irrelevant solutions.
- Principles and vision serve as a compass:
  - Avoids "activity traps" like working hard on irrelevant tasks.
  - Encourages focus on long-term outcomes.

---

### Definition:
- Covey’s focus is on intentionality: identifying clear goals and aligning efforts toward achieving them.
- Metaphor: A team hacking through a forest without a map may work efficiently but go nowhere.

### Software Development Parallel:
- **Without a clear “end”**:
  - Development effort can lead to technical debt, rework, or misaligned deliverables.
  - Example: Implementing features based on unclear or shifting requirements may result in costly rewrites.
- **With a clear “end”**:
  - Enables effective prioritization, better technical decisions, and alignment with customer needs.

---

## **Individual vs. Collective in Mob Programming**
### Individual Perspective:
1. **Personal North Star**:
   - Developers often bring individual priorities, like learning new technologies, improving skills, or adhering to coding practices.
   - **Potential Conflict**:
     - Example: A developer focusing on experimenting with a new framework might divert the mob from delivering value.
   - **Solution**:
     - Align individual goals with mob objectives. For instance, experimental learning can be integrated if it aligns with team deliverables.

2. **Avoiding Personal Biases**:
   - Individuals should avoid anchoring on personal opinions that detract from the team’s shared purpose.
   - Example: A developer insisting on TDD in all situations may delay progress on exploratory prototypes.

---

### Collective Perspective:
1. **Shared Vision**:
   - Mob programming requires the collective to align on a unified vision of the “end.”
   - **Challenge**:
     - Diverse team values (e.g., prioritizing speed vs. maintainability) may cause tension.
   - **Solution**:
     - Collaborative discussions to establish common ground, using tools like a team charter.

2. **Benefits of Alignment**:
   - Teams that agree on the "end in mind" work more cohesively, reduce friction, and deliver value faster.
   - Example:
     - A mob building a payment gateway agrees on key goals: scalability, security, and compliance. This alignment ensures decisions reflect these priorities, avoiding shortcuts that compromise quality.

---

## **Anti-Patterns in Mob Programming**
### **1. Product Owner (PO)-Centered Mobs**
#### Description:
- Mobs overly focused on satisfying the PO’s immediate needs often:
  - Overprioritize short-term deliverables.
  - Neglect technical practices like testing or documentation.
- **Example**:
  - A PO requests a feature, and the mob rushes to deliver it without adding tests. A bug in production later doubles the effort required to fix it.

#### Consequences:
- Leads to unstable teams due to constant task-switching.
- Reduces psychological safety, as the mob fears questioning the PO.

#### Solution:
- Shift focus to principles like delivering long-term value.
  - Example: Using *cost of delay* to prioritize tasks ensures the team balances urgent and strategic needs.
- Encourage open dialogue with the PO.
  - Example: The mob presents trade-offs for rushing a feature (e.g., higher risk of defects).

---

### **2. Enemy-Centered Mobs**
#### Description:
- Individuals who focus on the perceived flaws of teammates disrupt mob dynamics.
- **Example**:
  - A developer criticizes another’s coding skills, creating tension and reducing productivity.

#### Consequences:
- Lowers team morale and psychological safety.
- Encourages mob members to disengage rather than collaborate.

#### Solution:
- Promote coaching over criticism.
  - Example: Instead of highlighting flaws, a skilled developer mentors others during the mob session.
- Focus on collective improvement.
  - Example: Use retrospectives to address skill gaps constructively.

---

### **3. Activity Without Purpose**
#### Description:
- Mobs that focus on "doing" without clear outcomes fall into the “activity trap.”
- **Example**:
  - A mob spends hours refining a small piece of code that doesn’t contribute to the sprint goal.

#### Consequences:
- Waste of resources and time.
- Frustration when progress doesn’t translate into meaningful results.

#### Solution:
- Establish a clear, shared purpose at the beginning of each session.
  - Example: Use tools like “definition of done” to ensure tasks contribute to project goals.

---

## **Principle-Centered Mobs**
### Characteristics of Principle-Centered Teams:
1. **Guided by Core Principles**:
   - Examples:
     - TDD for quality assurance.
     - Continuous refactoring for maintainability.
     - Lean principles to avoid waste.
   - Example: A mob agrees to follow the Scout Rule: “Leave the codebase cleaner than you found it.”

2. **Consistent Framework for Decisions**:
   - Example: When faced with a trade-off (e.g., speed vs. quality), the mob defaults to principles like sustainable delivery.

---

### How to Develop Principle-Centered Mobs:
1. **Create a Team Charter**:
   - Define shared principles and objectives.
   - Example: “Our mob prioritizes TDD and CI/CD practices over quick fixes.”
2. **Embed Principles in Workflow**:
   - Example: Integrate retrospectives after each mob session to reflect on adherence to principles.

---

## **Practical Techniques to Align Mobs**
### Diagnostic Questions:
1. **Why Are We Doing This?**
   - Use the "5 Whys" to uncover root motivations.
   - Example: A team fixing a bug asks, “Why did this bug occur?” and uncovers a deeper need for improved testing practices.
2. **What Principles Guide Us?**
   - Example: A mob might prioritize customer value over output by aligning with the lean principle of reducing waste.

---

### Reframing with Storytelling:
1. **Historical Lessons**:
   - Share past experiences to guide current decisions.
   - Example: A senior developer shares how ignoring documentation created onboarding challenges, encouraging the mob to prioritize documentation.

2. **Ship of Theseus Analogy**:
   - Helps teams see their codebase as an evolving entity.
   - Example: A mob realizes that even small refactorings contribute to the product’s long-term health.

---

## **Amplification in Mob Programming**
### Visibility of Team Dynamics:
- Mobbing highlights team emotions and challenges in real-time.
  - Example: A mob notices frustration over task-switching, prompting a discussion about better backlog management.

---

## **Key Takeaways for Software Engineering**
1. **Principle-Centered Goals**:
   - Align mob programming efforts with principles like clean code, sustainability, and customer value.
2. **Avoid Anti-Patterns**:
   - Watch for traps like PO-centered mobs or personal conflicts.
3. **Enable Continuous Alignment**:
   - Use tools like charters, retrospectives, and storytelling to ensure the mob remains focused on its North Star.
