# questions to ask before marriages

- what are available pre-marriage counselling?

- Define marriage. What is its purpose?
- Do you believe that marriage is a contract? Why or why not?
- How do you think your fiancé will answer these questions?

- Read the following quotations. After you have read each of them indicate which portions you agree with and which portions you disagree with?

>“Marriage resembles a pair of shears, so joined that they cannot be separated; often moving in opposite directions, yet always punishing anyone who comes between them. Is marriage a private action of two persons in love, or a public act of two pledging a contract? Neither, it is something other. Very much other! Basically, the Christian view of marriage is not that it is primarily or essentially a binding legal
and social contract. The Christian understands marriage as a covenant made under God and in the presence of fellow members of the Christian family. Such a pledge endures, not because of the force of law or the fear of its actions, but because an unconditional covenant has been made. A covenant more solemn, more binding, more permanent than any legal contract.”2
>
>“A system by means of which persons who are sinful and contentious are so caught up by a dream and a purpose bigger than themselves
>that they work through the years, in spite of repeated disappointment, to make the dream come true.”   
>
>“Marriage is a relationship between man and woman intended by God to be a monogamous relationship, intended to be a permanent bond
in which many needs are satisfied—the need to love and be loved, the need for deep friendship, for sharing, for companionship, for sexual satisfaction, for children, the need to escape loneliness. Marriage ought to be a bond of love, reflecting the love Christ has for His people, a bond of sacrificial love where husband and wife have become one, one flesh, a unity."

Here is another definition of marriage that you may want to consider. 

>“The marriage relationship is a school, a learning and growing environment in which (if everything is as it should be) both partners can grow and develop. The relationship grows along with them. If you can see marriage as an opportunity for growth, you can be >satisfied and can satisfy your spouse.”
>
>Dr. David Hubbard graphically described the marriage relationship when he said, “Marriage does not demand perfection. But it must be given priority. It is an institution for sinners. No one else need apply. But it finds its finest glory when sinners see it as God’s way of leading us through his ultimate curriculum of love and righteousness.” Have you ever thought about the purpose of marriage in that light?
>
>Here’s another definition of marriage. Consider it carefully, and then talk over your feelings with your partner: “A Christian marriage is a total commitment of two people to the person of Jesus Christ and to each other. It is a commitment in which nothing is held back. Marriage is a pledge of mutual fidelity; it is a partnership of mutual subordination. 

>A Christian marriage is similar to a solvent, a freeing up of the man and woman to be themselves and become all that God intends for them to become. Marriage is a refining process that God will use to have us become the man or woman He wants us to become. Think about it. God will use your marriage for His purpose. He will mold and refine you for your own benefit and for His glory.” 

>You may be thinking that when you marry there will be two individuals involved in that marriage. That is true, but there is a third party who can give an even greater meaning to your individual and married life—that person is Jesus Christ. In what way will the presence of Jesus Christ in your life make a difference in your marriage?

- What will you receive out of marriage that you wouldn’t receive by remaining single?
- On a separate piece of paper, list the reasons why you are marrying your fiancé. After you have done that, list the reasons why you think your fiancé is marrying you. Then share the results.

- Now compare your reasons for marriage with the following list, which has been compiled by several specialists in marriage and family life education. These are unhealthy reasons for marriage. If you find that any of these appear either on your list or in your mind, you should spend time discussing them with your fiancé and your marriage advisor.
  - To spite or get back at your parents.
  - Because of a negative self-image—marrying
  - your fiancé will make you feel worthwhile and will give meaning to your life.
  - To be a therapist or counselor to your fiancé.
  - Fear of being left out—being single forever.
  - Fear of independence.
  - Marrying on the rebound—you were hurt in a former love relationship and to ease your hurt you immediately choose another.
  - Fear of hurting the other person—you’re afraid of what will happen to your fiancé if you break up even though you know that marriage is not the answer.
  - To escape an unhappy home.
  - Because you are pregnant or your fiancé is pregnant.
  - Because you have had sex.
  - Companionship.

- **A Love Problem?**

After eight years of marriage Ken tells a marriage counselor that he no longer has any romantic feelings for his wife. “It isn’t like when we were first married,” he says. “I knew without a doubt I loved her then. I had strong emotional feelings that were unmistakable. Now that is all gone. I admire her. She is a wonderful woman, a good wife and mother. I’m really more attracted to a girl I used to date in high school.”

Sandy is frustrated over the whole matter. She says she loves her husband and children and wants to hold her family together.

Neither wants a divorce. “How can I regain that loving feeling for my wife?” he asks. “Was it something I did to destroy his love for me?” she asks.

- **Your Marriage Needs Three Types of Love — Eros, Philia, Agape**

Eros is the love that seeks sensual expression. Eros is romantic love, sexual love. It is inspired by the biological structure of human nature. The husband and wife, in a good marriage, will love each other romantically and erotically.

In a good marriage, the husband and wife are also friends. Friendship means companionship, communication, and cooperation. This is known as philia.

Agape is self-giving love, gift love, the love that goes on loving even when the other becomes unlovable. Agape love is not just something that happens to you; it’s something you make happen. Love is a personal act of commitment. Christ’s love (and hence the pattern for our love) is gift love. Christ’s love for us is sacrificial love. Christ’s love is unconditional. Christ’s love is an eternal love. Agape is kindness. It is being sympathetic, thoughtful, and sensitive to the needs of your loved one. Agape is contentment. Agape love is forgiving love.

- Take your fiancé’s list and read it to yourself. As you read each one of your fiancé’s expectations of you, place a check mark under the appropriate column. C stands for “cinch.” You feel that the expectation you have just read is going to be a cinch to fulfill. S stands for “sweat.” It will take some hard work and sweat, but it can be done. N stands for “no way.” You feel that the expectation is impossible.

- It has been suggested that most couples go through these three stages (enchantment, disenchantment, maturity). What about you? Perhaps in your own relationship you have experienced some of the disenchantment stage already. Do you want to go through the full extent of the disenchantment stage as you see it expressed here? If not, then take some time to write out what you can do as an individual and what you can do as a couple to keep from going through all of the experiences of this stage. When you have finished writing, share your responses together.

- Complete the following statements and then share your responses with your fiancé.

  - “In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise -and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ” (1 Peter 1:6,7 NASB).

  - “Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those who love Him” (James 1:12 NASB).

- How will the presence of Jesus Christ in your life help you to fulfill your expectations of marriage and accept the ones that are not fulfilled?

- How would you define communication? What do you think the word means? Write your definition and then share your answer with your fiancé.
  - Communication is the process of sharing yourself, both verbally and nonverbally, in such a way that the other person can both accept and understand what you are sharing.

- What do we mean by listening? When we are truly listening to another person, we are not thinking about what we are going to say when he or she stops talking. We are not busy formulating our response. We are concentrating on what is being said. Listening is also complete acceptance without judgment of what is said or how it is said. Often we fail to hear the message because we don’t like the message or the tone of voice. We react and miss the meaning of what was being shared.

- what are the main components of communication?
  - The three components of communication must be complementary. One researcher has suggested the following breakdown of the importance of the three components.22 The percentages indicate how much of the message is sent through each one.
    - Content / 7%
    - Tone / 38%
    - Nonverbal / 55%

- How will you communicate in the following situations?
  - 1. It’s Saturday. Your spouse asks you to shop for something, but you really don’t want to go. You say:
  - 2. You are trying to watch your favorite TV program but your spouse is continually interrupting and asking you questions. The program is at the crucial part, and you don’t want to miss it. You say:

- what are 5 levels of communications?
  - Level Five: Cliché Conversation. This type of talk is very safe. We use phrases such as “How are you?” “How’s the dog?” “Where have you been?” “I like your dress.” In this type of conversation there is no personal sharing. Each person remains safely behind his defenses.
  - Level Four: Reporting the Facts About Others. In this kind of conversation we are content to tell others what someone else has said, but we offer no personal information on these facts. We report the facts like the six o’clock news. We share gossip and little narrations, but we do not commit ourselves as to how we feel about them.
  - Level Three: Ideas and Judgments. Real communication begins to unfold here. The person is willing to step out of his solitary confinement and risk telling some of his ideas and decisions. He is still cautious. If he senses that what he is saying is not being accepted, he will retreat.
  - Level Two: Feelings or Emotions. At this level the person shares how he feels about facts, ideas, and judgments. His feelings underneath these areas are revealed. For a person to really share himself with another individual he must move to the level of sharing his feelings.
  - Level One: Complete Emotional and Personal Communication. All deep relationships must be based on absolute openness and honesty. This may be difficult to achieve because it involves risk—the risk of being rejected. But it is vital if relationships are to grow. There will be times when this type of communication is not as complete as it could be.
