# Goals/Key Ideas/Context
- you should not reach for abstractions, but instead you should resist them until they absolutely insist upon being created.
- writing code is the process of working your way to the next stable end point, not the end point itself
# rediscovering simplicity
## judging the code
- evaluating code based on opinion
  - look for context/concrete guidance of what the code trying to accomplish
  - **any pile of code can be made to work; good code not only works, but it also simple, understandable, expressive and changeable**
