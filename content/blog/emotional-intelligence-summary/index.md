# Key Ideas, Goals, Context
- The communication between the emotional and rational portions of your brain is the physical source of emotional intelligence.
  - ![communication between emotional and rational portions](./emotional-rational-portions-communication.png)
- What you think, say, and do can increase your EQ.
- IQ: cognitive intelligence, your ability to learn; a set of ability that doesn't change overtime (except in cases of traumatic injury)
- EQ: emotional intelligence, your skills of being aware of your emotions and those of others along with managing your emotions and your relationships; a skill that you can learn.
- personality: your temperament or style; a preference that is stable over a lifetime.
- 8 statements/characteristics to define emotionally intelligent people
  - They listen and learn from criticism
  - They maintain a positive (solution mode) attitude to difficult situations
  - They manage anxiety, fear, anger and all emotions appropriately in all situations.
  - They recognize how their behaviors affect others
  - They are empathetic
  - They have discipline and are self-motivated
  - They listen even if they disagree
  - They look for ways to improve when things don't go according to plan.
  - **EI is about figuring out how to apply, adapt, and deliver based on the needs of the person we're with and what stage of the process they're in**

# EI Rewiring Process
- Own it, Face it, Feel it, Ask it, Drive it
- sometimes, our sub-conscious mind causes us to try and validate our emotional response consciously. For example, if you're not feeling great, you might be looking for ways that the day is bad or getting worse.
- power of pause: pausing after someone's answered a question of said something (for dramatic effect) to encourage them to draw upon their sub-conscious mind and bring deeper thoughts/feelings to the conversation.
- Identify our own belief and values
- "Our own minds is what created fear and our own mind is the only thing that can smash through it"
- Ask yourself: 'Do I want to change this? Why do I want to change this?' What stands to happen if I don't change this? What stands to happen if I don't change this?'
- accepting that something is going to happen and that the only thing we can control is how we choose to response is where EI comes in.

# Empathy
- Sympathy is feeling sorry for someone where as empathy is recognizing the emotional response someone is having and how it feels to have that emotional response
  - Putting yourself in their shoes is dangerous because that typically comes with judgement
  - We don't need to know what has happened, just recognize what emotion and the severity of that emotion

## Steps to Empathy
- Recognize which emotion the person is feeling
- Recall the last time you felt that emotion
  - What was the best and worst thing someone could have said or done to you in that moment
  - First thing we want is to be heard
- Respond
  - Help the other person gain control of their emotions and feel a connection

# Quotes

"Emotional intelligence is your ability to recognize and understand emotions in yourself and others, and your ability to use this awareness to manage your behavior and relationships"

"If I could sum up emotional in 2 words, it would  be 'own it'"

replace "why is this happening to me" with "what is this trying to teach me?", everything shifts.

"today I refuse to stress myself out about things I cannot control or change?"

"be crazy, be stupid, be silly, be weird, be whatever, because life is too short to be anything but happy."

"Our own minds is what created fear and our own mind is the only thing that can smash through it"

"Begin by asking yourself, "What emotion to I want to trigger in this situation?"

Ask yourself: 'Do I want to change this? Why do I want to change this?' What stands to happen if I don't change this? What stands to happen if I don't change this?'

Accepting that something is going to happen and that the only thing we can control is how we choose to respond is where EI comes in
