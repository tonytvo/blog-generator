- an owner-occupied investment property is a home that has been purchased as an investment but that also functions as a primary residence for the investor. Because America loves homeowners, investing in real estate that doubles as a home satisfies the country's love of homeownership.
- You can consider a single-family home as an investment if you purchase it with the intention of using it as a real estate investment in the future or if you can build substantial equity by doing something like rehab and then parlay that equity into greater investments later.
- small multifamily properties, such as duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes, are eligible for the same American benefits as single-family homes. That is, they are low cost, easy to obtain financing for, and offer the potential to generate constant monthly income.
- FHA loan is a government backed loan that allows you to purchase property. However, it also has its share of problems, such as the Mortgage insurance premium that can really add up and the fact that you can have only 1 FHA loan at a time.
  - 203k loan (renovation loan in canada) is a subset of the FHA program and allows the borrower to borrow money to pay for cosmetic repairs such as paint and carpet.
  - the biggest difference between a regular 203k loan and a streamlined one is the extent of the rehab. The streamlined one can be used for smaller cosmetic problems, like painting, carpet, and smells, whereas the regular one can be used for structural changes, like moving walls or building additions.
- investing in real estate with partners to avoid large amount of money upfront
- your brand consists of yourself and your product.
  - your personal brand is built through 3 primary areas: reputation, knowledge, and experience. Use your gaps in knowledge as motivation to grow
  - your BRRR approach requires you to develop a strong and consistent product.
- there are 4 different ways you can partner
  - equity partnership
  - down payment equity partnership
  - private lending partnership
  - credit partnership
- before partnering with someone, you must speak with a CPA and a lawyer who specializes in this kind of thing.
- the main reason why partnerships fail is because of personality conflicts. In addition, differences in opinion and suspicion/trust issues can cause problems as well
- home equity loan or line of credit can be used/borrowed to invest in real estate. 
  - it generally has low interest rates, which is generally tied to the prime rate, but the interest rates are adjustable and high during inflation period, which is another risk to take into account
  - another risk you take is if you house's value decreases.
- another strategy is to refinancing your load through the bank after the repairs.
- another option is to get a business line of credit from a commercial bank or portfolio lender. This allows you to access the equity in your properties.
- by using your home's equity to fund your real estate purchase, you're reducing the amount of cash flow you receive. Getting a good deal on the property is even more crucial to make up for this reduction.
