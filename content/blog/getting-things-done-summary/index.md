# Goals/Context for having a todo list
- trusted place I can easily find and look at to see additional/support information on any projects that are working on
- a reliable place for ideas and tasks
- maintain perspective and trust in the focus and the priorities
- getting in-tray(s) to zero
- avoid open loops and cognitive loads in mind to remember the open loops
- reference system to retrieve information within 30 seconds or less
- easy to access the visualization of the tasks in the inbox/today/next action lists, so it’s easier for you to take action
- Pair this with [Tiago Forte's PARA system](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/), start using [progressive summarization](https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/)
- 3 key objectives:
  - Capture all the things to get done, or that have usefulness for you, outside your head (and therefore off your mind).
  - Decide about what "inputs" you allow into your life, which dictate your list of "next actions".
  - Continue to curate and coordinate all that content, so you can access it at any time.
- The key ingredients in relaxed control are:
  - (1) clearly defined outcomes (projects) and the next actions required to move them toward closure, and
  - (2) reminders placed in a trusted system that is reviewed regularly. This is what I call horizontal focus


# Getting Started

- Sign up for Zapier and build one very simple automation. It doesn’t matter which one. Maybe create some kind of reminder.
- Sign up for Todoist and start just putting tasks into the Inbox. Maybe create a few Projects. Install it on your phone. Practise using it to get things out of your head for a couple of weeks.
- If you decide after a few weeks that you don’t hate Todoist, spend one afternoon/evening doing the Core Dump, where you just create Projects and add Tasks until everything seems out of your head. It is probably not that important to have links from Todoist tasks back to specific emails as long as you know what to search for in Gmail when needed.

# Write down ideas and to-do items when they first show up
- make it easy to extract the information out of the brains
  - it usually takes less than 30 seconds to create the todo item on the phone
  - index cards can be used to write down ideas, but the items on index cards need to be transferred to Todoist
- apply a label to an email, which then is picked up by Zapier action and creates a card in Trello with the text of the email
- use the Todoist Gmail plugin to create a task and put it in the in-tray
  - [Use Gmail with Todoist](https://todoist.com/help/articles/use-gmail-with-todoist)
  - It is probably not that important to have links from Todoist tasks back to specific emails as long as you know what to search for in Gmail when you need it
- If there’s an inbox item and There’s no project fit for it, it should be deleted forever.
- create a todo item from a voice command
  - [How to use Todoist for Google Assistant](https://todoist.com/help/articles/how-to-use-todoist-for-google-assistant)
    - "OK, Google, Ask Todoist to add a task. Wash the car today."
  - Siri Action
    - [Shortcut Action](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios)
    - Tell the action's title to Siri, and it prompts the card's title.
- Inbox/Task List: a combination of Todoist and 1-5 index cards.
- core Dump where you just create Projects and add Tasks until everything seems out of your head
- [Remind Yourself To Schedule A Thing](https://blog.jbrains.ca/permalink/remind-yourself-to-schedule-x)
- When you choose not to document something in your inbox
  - what does that choice feel like?
  - when this happens, what do you do instead? (Keep it in your brain's memory? Write it on a piece of paper. Something else?)
  - why did you choose not to do the task?
    - forgot to think about it
    - thought about it but never felt like I could schedule it because I had other things to do that I consciously decided were more urgent
    - thought about it and consciously decided, "I'll do it later," but then I forgot to think about it a second time.
    - thought about it and consciously decided, "I can't justify taking time from my schedule to do this now," but then I forgot to think about it a second time.
    - some other reason
  - after deciding the reason(s) not to do the task
    - move the item from your inbox into a new Project. Let this project have only one task: do it! Move this new Project up your list of Projects until everything above it is more urgent
    - create a new recurring task called "Decide when to do (the original task)." Remind yourself once per week. If you notice that you never even decide when to do the original task, then the original task wasn't important enough or urgent enough. **Throw it away, and maybe it comes back**
    - pick an exact time to do the task, and then put that on your calendar. At the moment that time arrives, either you do the task, or you throw it away (and maybe one day it comes back)

# The Five Steps of Mastering Workflow

## Capture: 

- you need somewhere to put everything (physical tray, digital tool, etc.).
  - Minimize the number of capture locations
  - Empty the capture tools regularly

## Clarify: 

- be clear about what is required and how it will get done.
  - Is it actionable?
  - What's the next action?
  - Do it, delegate it, or defer it.

- **2-minute rule**
  - if the next action can be done in 2 minutes or less, do it now


## Organize: 

- make sure things are where you expect them to be.
- For non-action items: trash, incubation, reference.
  - For action items, add a calendar and a list of reminders to the project.

- 7 primary types of things to keep track of
  - A Projects list
    - **Projects: any desired result that can be accomplished within a year that requires more than one action step.**
    - You should have an index of projects where you capture relevant information and tasks.
    - For actions: they should go on a Next Actions list (not your calendar!).
    - **Keep a Single list of all current projects**
      - add a project to the Todoist projects list

  - Project support material
  
  - **Calendar actions and information**
    - to keep the calendar as the most trusted part of the todo system, use it to record the following kinds of information
      - time-specific actions: i.e. appointments, reserved time for a certain activity
      - day-specific actions: i.e. a shipment must be sent today
      - day-specific information: i.e. daughter’s birthday, office moves, etc.
  - **Next Actions lists**
    - apply the Todoist label next action on the task
    - **make sure each project has at least one task with a next-action label**
    - If you can’t even guess the effort of a smaller next action, then maybe the next action is “Spend 30 minutes figuring out what it means to complete this project”. Maybe the lack of vision/clarity about the “acceptance criteria” makes it hard for you to know where to start.
      - describe one next action which you can guess how long it will take—even if that next action is tiny or seems insignificant. That means moving the item from Inbox to New Project, then writing two tasks for that project:
        - the new, smaller next action
        - figure out how to do the rest of this project

  - **A Waiting For list**
    - apply the Todoist label wait-for for the specific task
  
  - **Reference material**
    - **Store and access (reference material easily when needed, whether it is paper or digital)**
    - Reference: a combination of Standard Notes and one Git repository (Or Google Drive), which I back up on Gitlab.
    - coming up with keywords with: “How am I likely to search for this six months from now.”
    - Google Drive folder name general-reference. Organized by keywords like general-reference/meme. Each folder is mapped to a keyword.
    - tags note appropriately so it can be found later.
  
  - **A Someday/Maybe list**
    - Add Someday/Maybe as a project in todoist


- **Get in-tray(s) (paper or digital) to empty every day or so**

- The most common categories of action reminders:
  - Calls
  - At Computer
  - Errands
  - At Office (miscellaneous)
  - At Home
  - Anywhere
  - Agendas (for people and meetings)
  - Read/Review

## Reflect: 

- What Is the Weekly Review?
  - Very simply, the Weekly Review is whatever you need to do to get your head empty again and get oriented for the next couple of weeks. It’s going through the steps of workflow management—capturing, clarifying, organizing, and reviewing all your outstanding commitments, intentions, and inclinations—until you can honestly say, "I know right now everything I’m not doing but could be doing if I decided to."
  - From a practical standpoint, here is the three-part drill that can get you there: get clear, get current, and get creative.
    - Getting clear will ensure that all your collected stuff is processed.
    - Getting current will ensure that all your orienting “maps" or lists are reviewed and up-to-date.
    - The creative part happens to some degree automatically. As you get clear and current—you will naturally generate ideas and perspectives that add value to your thinking about work and life.
  - use project template GTD Weekly review from Todoist


- The Right Time and Place for the Review
  - I recommend you block out two hours (too long, maybe 30 minutes?) early in the afternoon of your last workday for the review.

- The "Bigger Picture" Reviews
  - Yes, at some point, you must clarify the larger outcomes, the long-term goals, the visions and principles that ultimately drive, test, and prioritize your decisions.
  - What are your key goals and objectives in your work? What should you have in place a year or three years from now? How is your career going? Is this the lifestyle that is most fulfilling to you? Are you doing what you want or need to do from a deeper and longer-term perspective?

- **regularly review the professional and personal todo list**
- daily review
- use embedded widgets from Todoist on phone/browser, so the tasks in inbox/next action/today can easily be viewed and acted on.
- identify and address your limiting criteria
- context, time available, the energy available (tackle frog labels with the highest energy), and priority
- recommended at least 60-90 minutes daily, but I often only have 5 mins to do it.
- tasks that are hard to classify
  - “I just want to remember to have the option to do this task, but I’m OK if it waits five years.” Put it in Someday/Maybe or create a new project for it.
  - “I just need to decide whether to do it or not.” Set a reminder for “Decide when to do X,” or just put the damn thing on your calendar.
  - maybe, just **delete it, and it will come back if it is significant enough**
  - resolve the possible guilt about it. Put it out of your mind. You can do it either by deciding “I’m going to do it on a Specific date” or “I’m going just to put it in the list, and I’m happy if I do it next week, next month, next year, or next decade.”
- when reviewing the inbox
  - use Projects aggressively
  - if there are no projects fit for an item, delete it forever.

## Engage: 

- One model is to choose based on: context, time available, energy available, and priority.
- The Six-Level Model for Reviewing Your Work
  - The six levels of work may be thought of in terms of altitude, as in the floors of a building:
  - Horizon 5: Life
  - Horizon 4: Long-term visions
  - Horizon 3: One- to two-year goals
  - Horizon 2: Areas of focus and accountability
  - Horizon 1: Current projects
  - Ground: Current actions
- It's recommended that you start at the Ground, complete your action lists, and work your way up.


# Getting Projects Under Control

- You need to set up systems and tricks that get you to think about your projects and situations more frequently, easily, and in depth.
- There are two types of projects, however, that deserve at least some sort of planning activity: (1) those that still have your attention even after you’ve determined their next actions and (2) those about which potentially useful ideas and supportive detail just show up ad hoc.
  - The first type—the projects you know have other things that must be decided on and organized—will need a more detailed approach than just identifying the next action. For these, you’ll need a more specific application of one or more of the other four phases of the natural planning model: purpose and principles, vision/outcome, brainstorming, and/or organizing.
  - The second type—the projects for which ideas just show up, ad hoc, when you’re on a beach or in a car or at a meeting—need to have an appropriate place to capture these associated ideas. Then they can reside there for later use as needed.
- Tools matter for supporting project thinking. Some tips:
  - Make sure you always have a method of capturing ideas and information on hand.
  - Keep good writing tools around all the time.
  - Have whiteboards around where you can.


# power of key principles

- **The Power of the Capturing Habit**
  - When people with whom you interact notice that without fail, you receive, process, and organize in an airtight manner the exchanges and agreements they have with you, they begin to trust you uniquely.
  - More significantly, you incorporate self-confidence in your engagement with your world that money cannot buy.
  - It noticeably enhances your mental well-being and improves the quality of your communications and relationships, both personally and professionally.

  - **How Much Capturing is Required?**
    - When will you know how much you have left in your head to capture? Only when there’s nothing left.
    - When the only thing on your mind is the only thing on your mind, you’ll be “present," in your “zone," with no distinction between work and play.
    - This doesn’t mean that your mind will be empty. If you’re conscious, your mind will always be focusing on something. But if it’s focusing on only one thing at a time, without distraction, you’ll be in your “zone."
    - I suggest you use your mind to think about things rather than think of them.

- **When a culture adopts "What’s the next action?" as a standard operating query, there’s an automatic increase in energy, productivity, clarity, and focus.**

# The Path of GTD Mastery

- **The Three Tiers of Mastery**
  - 1 | Employing the fundamentals of managing workflow;
  - 2 | Implementing a more elevated and integrated total life management system
  - 3 | Leveraging skills to create clear space and get things done for an ever-expansive expression and manifestation.

- **Mastering the Basics**
  - Other basic practices, which, even if implemented initially, easily regress into incomplete, out-of-date, and therefore dysfunctional usage, include:
  - Avoiding next-action decision-making on "stuff to do."
  - Fully utilizing the "Waiting For" category, such that every expected deliverable from others is inventoried and reviewed for follow-up in adequate timing
  - Using Agenda lists to capture and manage communications with others
  - Keeping a simple, easily accessible filing and reference system
  - Keeping the calendar a pure "hard landscape" without undermining its trustworthiness with extraneous inputs
  - Doing Weekly Reviews to keep one’s system functional and current

- **Graduate Level–Integrated Life Management**
  - a complete, current, and clear inventory of projects;
  - a working map of one’s roles, accountabilities, and interests—personally and professionally;
  - an integrated total life management system, custom tailored to one’s current needs and direction and utilized to dynamically steer out beyond the day-to-day
  - challenges and surprises trigger your utilization of this methodology instead of throwing you out of it.

# Quotes

If it's on your mind, your mind isn't clear. Anything unfinished must be captured in a trusted system outside your mind.

"The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small, manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one."—Mark Twain

"There are only two problems in life:
(1) you know what you want, and you don’t know how to get it; and/or
(2) you don’t know what you want."
