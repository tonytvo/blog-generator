# key take-aways
- trusted place I can easily find and look at to see additional/support information on any projects that are working on
- a reliable place for ideas and tasks
- maintain perspective and trust in the focus and the priorities
- getting in-tray(s) to zero
- avoid open loops and cognitive loads in mind to remember the open loops
- reference system to retrieve information within 30 seconds or less
- easy to access the visualization of the tasks in the inbox/today/next action lists, so it’s easier for you to take action
- Pair this with [Tiago Forte's PARA system](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/), start using [progressive summarization](https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/)
- 3 key objectives:
  - Capture all the things to get done, or that have usefulness for you, outside your head (and therefore off your mind).
  - Decide about what "inputs" you allow into your life, which dictate your list of "next actions".
  - Continue to curate and coordinate all that content, so you can access it at any time.
- The key ingredients in relaxed control are:
  - (1) clearly defined outcomes (projects) and the next actions required to move them toward closure, and
  - (2) reminders placed in a trusted system that is reviewed regularly. This is what I call horizontal focus
- Execution is a process.
- Always be asking how and what, ask questions and remain accountable.
- Part of executing means that you need to be in a position to understand the business environment and the organisations capabilities.
- Business leaders have three key roles when it comes to the execution: selecting the right people, setting the strategic direction and coordinating operations.
- Execution needs to be a core part of company culture, it needs to be the norm and something that all employees understand.
- If you can get everyone moving in the same direction and at the same time then successful execution is much more likely.
- By changing people’s behaviours, you are having a direct impact on the results they produce.
- It’s important to ensure that the behavioural changes you encourage, promote a positive outcome.
- It is the job of the leader to select the right people for the right roles.
- It’s important to continuously develop the people who work for you.
- Bossidy has identified three processes that should be at the core of execution. The people process, the strategy process, and the operation process.
- The people process is all about linking the people to strategy and operations.
- Having the right people understand how to translate the strategy into an operational reality.
- The people process defines who is going to help the business get to the end goal.
- Establishing this link will encourage people to remain focused and motivated and will keep everyone accountable.
- The strategy process is all about linking the people to operations.
- The strategy is designed to identify where the business is headed and how it’s getting there.
- A strategy is essentially an action plan.
- It’s absolutely essential that your strategy not only addresses the what but also the how.
- The operations process is all about linking the strategy to the people.
- The final piece of the puzzle is the operation process, designed to define the road ahead, the path the people can follow.



# Getting Started

- Sign up for Zapier and build one very simple automation. It doesn’t matter which one. Maybe create some kind of reminder.
- Sign up for Todoist and start just putting tasks into the Inbox. Maybe create a few Projects. Install it on your phone. Practise using it to get things out of your head for a couple of weeks.
- If you decide after a few weeks that you don’t hate Todoist, spend one afternoon/evening doing the Core Dump, where you just create Projects and add Tasks until everything seems out of your head. It is probably not that important to have links from Todoist tasks back to specific emails as long as you know what to search for in Gmail when needed.

# Write down ideas and to-do items when they first show up
- make it easy to extract the information out of the brains
  - it usually takes less than 30 seconds to create the todo item on the phone
  - index cards can be used to write down ideas, but the items on index cards need to be transferred to Todoist
- apply a label to an email, which then is picked up by Zapier action and creates a card in Trello with the text of the email
- use the Todoist Gmail plugin to create a task and put it in the in-tray
  - [Use Gmail with Todoist](https://todoist.com/help/articles/use-gmail-with-todoist)
  - It is probably not that important to have links from Todoist tasks back to specific emails as long as you know what to search for in Gmail when you need it
- If there’s an inbox item and There’s no project fit for it, it should be deleted forever.
- create a todo item from a voice command
  - [How to use Todoist for Google Assistant](https://todoist.com/help/articles/how-to-use-todoist-for-google-assistant)
    - "OK, Google, Ask Todoist to add a task. Wash the car today."
  - Siri Action
    - [Shortcut Action](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios)
    - Tell the action's title to Siri, and it prompts the card's title.
- Inbox/Task List: a combination of Todoist and 1-5 index cards.
- core Dump where you just create Projects and add Tasks until everything seems out of your head
- [Remind Yourself To Schedule A Thing](https://blog.jbrains.ca/permalink/remind-yourself-to-schedule-x)
- When you choose not to document something in your inbox
  - what does that choice feel like?
  - when this happens, what do you do instead? (Keep it in your brain's memory? Write it on a piece of paper. Something else?)
  - why did you choose not to do the task?
    - forgot to think about it
    - thought about it but never felt like I could schedule it because I had other things to do that I consciously decided were more urgent
    - thought about it and consciously decided, "I'll do it later," but then I forgot to think about it a second time.
    - thought about it and consciously decided, "I can't justify taking time from my schedule to do this now," but then I forgot to think about it a second time.
    - some other reason
  - after deciding the reason(s) not to do the task
    - move the item from your inbox into a new Project. Let this project have only one task: do it! Move this new Project up your list of Projects until everything above it is more urgent
    - create a new recurring task called "Decide when to do (the original task)." Remind yourself once per week. If you notice that you never even decide when to do the original task, then the original task wasn't important enough or urgent enough. **Throw it away, and maybe it comes back**
    - pick an exact time to do the task, and then put that on your calendar. At the moment that time arrives, either you do the task, or you throw it away (and maybe one day it comes back)

# The Five Steps of Mastering Workflow

## Capture: 

- you need somewhere to put everything (physical tray, digital tool, etc.).
  - Minimize the number of capture locations
  - Empty the capture tools regularly

## Clarify: 

- be clear about what is required and how it will get done.
  - Is it actionable?
  - What's the next action?
  - Do it, delegate it, or defer it.

- **2-minute rule**
  - if the next action can be done in 2 minutes or less, do it now


## Organize: 

- make sure things are where you expect them to be.
- For non-action items: trash, incubation, reference.
  - For action items, add a calendar and a list of reminders to the project.

- 7 primary types of things to keep track of
  - A Projects list
    - **Projects: any desired result that can be accomplished within a year that requires more than one action step.**
    - You should have an index of projects where you capture relevant information and tasks.
    - For actions: they should go on a Next Actions list (not your calendar!).
    - **Keep a Single list of all current projects**
      - add a project to the Todoist projects list

  - Project support material
  
  - **Calendar actions and information**
    - to keep the calendar as the most trusted part of the todo system, use it to record the following kinds of information
      - time-specific actions: i.e. appointments, reserved time for a certain activity
      - day-specific actions: i.e. a shipment must be sent today
      - day-specific information: i.e. daughter’s birthday, office moves, etc.
  - **Next Actions lists**
    - apply the Todoist label next action on the task
    - **make sure each project has at least one task with a next-action label**
    - If you can’t even guess the effort of a smaller next action, then maybe the next action is “Spend 30 minutes figuring out what it means to complete this project”. Maybe the lack of vision/clarity about the “acceptance criteria” makes it hard for you to know where to start.
      - describe one next action which you can guess how long it will take—even if that next action is tiny or seems insignificant. That means moving the item from Inbox to New Project, then writing two tasks for that project:
        - the new, smaller next action
        - figure out how to do the rest of this project

  - **A Waiting For list**
    - apply the Todoist label wait-for for the specific task
  
  - **Reference material**
    - **Store and access (reference material easily when needed, whether it is paper or digital)**
    - Reference: a combination of Standard Notes and one Git repository (Or Google Drive), which I back up on Gitlab.
    - coming up with keywords with: “How am I likely to search for this six months from now.”
    - Google Drive folder name general-reference. Organized by keywords like general-reference/meme. Each folder is mapped to a keyword.
    - tags note appropriately so it can be found later.
  
  - **A Someday/Maybe list**
    - Add Someday/Maybe as a project in todoist


- **Get in-tray(s) (paper or digital) to empty every day or so**

- The most common categories of action reminders:
  - Calls
  - At Computer
  - Errands
  - At Office (miscellaneous)
  - At Home
  - Anywhere
  - Agendas (for people and meetings)
  - Read/Review

## Reflect: 

- What Is the Weekly Review?
  - Very simply, the Weekly Review is whatever you need to do to get your head empty again and get oriented for the next couple of weeks. It’s going through the steps of workflow management—capturing, clarifying, organizing, and reviewing all your outstanding commitments, intentions, and inclinations—until you can honestly say, "I know right now everything I’m not doing but could be doing if I decided to."
  - From a practical standpoint, here is the three-part drill that can get you there: get clear, get current, and get creative.
    - Getting clear will ensure that all your collected stuff is processed.
    - Getting current will ensure that all your orienting “maps" or lists are reviewed and up-to-date.
    - The creative part happens to some degree automatically. As you get clear and current—you will naturally generate ideas and perspectives that add value to your thinking about work and life.
  - use project template GTD Weekly review from Todoist


- The Right Time and Place for the Review
  - I recommend you block out two hours (too long, maybe 30 minutes?) early in the afternoon of your last workday for the review.

- The "Bigger Picture" Reviews
  - Yes, at some point, you must clarify the larger outcomes, the long-term goals, the visions and principles that ultimately drive, test, and prioritize your decisions.
  - What are your key goals and objectives in your work? What should you have in place a year or three years from now? How is your career going? Is this the lifestyle that is most fulfilling to you? Are you doing what you want or need to do from a deeper and longer-term perspective?

- **regularly review the professional and personal todo list**
- daily review
- use embedded widgets from Todoist on phone/browser, so the tasks in inbox/next action/today can easily be viewed and acted on.
- identify and address your limiting criteria
- context, time available, the energy available (tackle frog labels with the highest energy), and priority
- recommended at least 60-90 minutes daily, but I often only have 5 mins to do it.
- tasks that are hard to classify
  - “I just want to remember to have the option to do this task, but I’m OK if it waits five years.” Put it in Someday/Maybe or create a new project for it.
  - “I just need to decide whether to do it or not.” Set a reminder for “Decide when to do X,” or just put the damn thing on your calendar.
  - maybe, just **delete it, and it will come back if it is significant enough**
  - resolve the possible guilt about it. Put it out of your mind. You can do it either by deciding “I’m going to do it on a Specific date” or “I’m going just to put it in the list, and I’m happy if I do it next week, next month, next year, or next decade.”
- when reviewing the inbox
  - use Projects aggressively
  - if there are no projects fit for an item, delete it forever.

## Engage: 

- One model is to choose based on: context, time available, energy available, and priority.
- The Six-Level Model for Reviewing Your Work
  - The six levels of work may be thought of in terms of altitude, as in the floors of a building:
  - Horizon 5: Life
  - Horizon 4: Long-term visions
  - Horizon 3: One- to two-year goals
  - Horizon 2: Areas of focus and accountability
  - Horizon 1: Current projects
  - Ground: Current actions
- It's recommended that you start at the Ground, complete your action lists, and work your way up.


# Getting Projects Under Control

- You need to set up systems and tricks that get you to think about your projects and situations more frequently, easily, and in depth.
- There are two types of projects, however, that deserve at least some sort of planning activity: (1) those that still have your attention even after you’ve determined their next actions and (2) those about which potentially useful ideas and supportive detail just show up ad hoc.
  - The first type—the projects you know have other things that must be decided on and organized—will need a more detailed approach than just identifying the next action. For these, you’ll need a more specific application of one or more of the other four phases of the natural planning model: purpose and principles, vision/outcome, brainstorming, and/or organizing.
  - The second type—the projects for which ideas just show up, ad hoc, when you’re on a beach or in a car or at a meeting—need to have an appropriate place to capture these associated ideas. Then they can reside there for later use as needed.
- Tools matter for supporting project thinking. Some tips:
  - Make sure you always have a method of capturing ideas and information on hand.
  - Keep good writing tools around all the time.
  - Have whiteboards around where you can.


# power of key principles

- **The Power of the Capturing Habit**
  - When people with whom you interact notice that without fail, you receive, process, and organize in an airtight manner the exchanges and agreements they have with you, they begin to trust you uniquely.
  - More significantly, you incorporate self-confidence in your engagement with your world that money cannot buy.
  - It noticeably enhances your mental well-being and improves the quality of your communications and relationships, both personally and professionally.

  - **How Much Capturing is Required?**
    - When will you know how much you have left in your head to capture? Only when there’s nothing left.
    - When the only thing on your mind is the only thing on your mind, you’ll be “present," in your “zone," with no distinction between work and play.
    - This doesn’t mean that your mind will be empty. If you’re conscious, your mind will always be focusing on something. But if it’s focusing on only one thing at a time, without distraction, you’ll be in your “zone."
    - I suggest you use your mind to think about things rather than think of them.

- **When a culture adopts "What’s the next action?" as a standard operating query, there’s an automatic increase in energy, productivity, clarity, and focus.**

# The Path of GTD Mastery

- **The Three Tiers of Mastery**
  - 1 | Employing the fundamentals of managing workflow;
  - 2 | Implementing a more elevated and integrated total life management system
  - 3 | Leveraging skills to create clear space and get things done for an ever-expansive expression and manifestation.

- **Mastering the Basics**
  - Other basic practices, which, even if implemented initially, easily regress into incomplete, out-of-date, and therefore dysfunctional usage, include:
  - Avoiding next-action decision-making on "stuff to do."
  - Fully utilizing the "Waiting For" category, such that every expected deliverable from others is inventoried and reviewed for follow-up in adequate timing
  - Using Agenda lists to capture and manage communications with others
  - Keeping a simple, easily accessible filing and reference system
  - Keeping the calendar a pure "hard landscape" without undermining its trustworthiness with extraneous inputs
  - Doing Weekly Reviews to keep one’s system functional and current

- **Graduate Level–Integrated Life Management**
  - a complete, current, and clear inventory of projects;
  - a working map of one’s roles, accountabilities, and interests—personally and professionally;
  - an integrated total life management system, custom tailored to one’s current needs and direction and utilized to dynamically steer out beyond the day-to-day
  - challenges and surprises trigger your utilization of this methodology instead of throwing you out of it.


# Discipline of GTD in organizations

## WHY EXECUTION IS NEEDED

### Failure

- Bossidy explains that when a company appears to be failing or breaking down the blame is often placed on the CEO. It’s assumed that the strategy the CEO had in place was wrong and is to blame. However, Bossidy stresses that often the strategy itself wasn’t wrong, but it wasn’t executed effectively. And this is where things start to fall apart. To be successful, you need more than just an excellent strategy, you also need excellent execution.

### Leading and execution

- Bossidy identifies execution as ‘the missing link between aspirations and results’. He believes that if you can learn how to connect the two, then success will follow. It’s important to note that execution is a discipline and needs to be practiced by company leaders at all levels. It’s not just a single component but it needs to be part of all strategies and goals. Without this, companies will fail to deliver.

- It’s so important that a business leader knows how to execute well. You can be a leader full of ideas and aspirations but without the ability to execute well, these ideas will amount to nothing.

- Bossidy identifies three key points to consider when thinking about execution:

  - Execution is a discipline, it’s a critical component of the strategy.
The business leader is responsible for encouraging and promoting execution.
Execution needs to be at the core of an organization's culture.
Discipline

  - Bossidy explains that you should think of execution as a process. Always be asking how and what, ask questions and remain accountable. Part of executing means that you need to be in a position to understand the business environment and the organization's capabilities. You need to be able to make assumptions and forecasts. Execution requires the ability to link strategy + operations + people who are going to execute the strategy. If these links aren’t clear and synchronized then the execution won’t be streamlined or effective. Therefore, Bossidy explains that there are three processes that are critical to effective execution: the people process, the strategy process, and the operations process.

### Business leaders

- Bossidy stresses the importance of having a great business leader who is totally committed to the company and has a clear understanding of the business and the current business environment. Without this commitment, a leader will not be in a position to execute strategies.

- Bossidy explains that business leaders have three key roles when it comes to execution. They must select the people who will also be managing the strategy and execution. The leader is responsible for setting the strategic direction and ensuring that everyone involved understands the goals. They are also in charge of coordinating operations. Bossidy stressed the importance of having the leader do these jobs, they are not something that should be delegated to a lower colleague.


### Culture

- Bossidy, like many other authors, stressed the importance of culture within a business. Bossidy explains that execution needs to be a core part of this culture, it needs to be the norm and something that all employees understand. A leader who executes is someone who is constantly analyzing the gap between the actual results and the desired results of any strategic plan. By learning from this gap they can take their knowledge onto the next project and make significant improvements.

- Although Bossidy has pointed out that execution is the responsibility of senior leaders, it doesn’t mean that everyone in any organization should practice the skills. By learning the skills of execution at any level, you will be making strides in advancing your career and eventually reaching that senior leadership role.

- It’s the combination of people as individuals and as a collective that aids execution. If you can get everyone moving in the same direction and at the same time then successful execution is much more likely. Bossidy explains that any leader that lacks the discipline of execution, isn’t really a leader at all. They must strive to be rigorous and consistent with their actions and encourage all team members to practice the discipline of execution.


## THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF EXECUTION

### Building block one: seven essential behaviours of a leader

- The first essential behaviour a leader needs is to know the people and the business. It’s so important that a leader is in touch with who they work with and the current business climate.

- Realism is the second behaviour that a leader needs. Rather than avoiding the truth a great leader needs to embrace the truth. And if this means identifying and acknowledging weaknesses then be as real as possible.

- Leaders need to be setting goals and priorities. It’s a good idea to focus on a few key goals that the entire team can focus on. Don’t overcomplicate things with too many goals or priorities.

- Being someone that always follows through is important for a leader, it means that people will believe what you say and take you seriously. Never be someone who has a lot to say but never puts anything into action.
The fifth behaviour a leader must have is the ability to reward people. In doing so you encourage your team to work hard and achieve results. Consider bonuses, pay rises or stocks.

- Pass on knowledge, always expanding other people's capabilities. Someone that you work with may be the leader one day so it’s important to share as much knowledge as possible.

- Leaders need to be strong characters who know themselves well. Accepting and acknowledging your own weaknesses and working to improve these is a great traits for a leader. It’s important that leaders are self-aware, have humility and are authentic.

### Building block two: cultural change

- Bossidy explains that companies often focus on changing their strategy and structures. But they fail to work on the people, beliefs, and behaviours of those that they work with. He emphasizes that cultural change is just as important (if not more) as strategy and structure.

- Bossidy identifies that companies that make an effort to change their culture often fail because they don’t find a direct link between culture and business outcomes. When the changes are so disconnected, they are not likely to succeed. A business needs to understand the deep connections between company culture and business outcomes.

- **Change people's behaviour**
  
  - By changing people’s behaviours, you are having a direct impact on the results they produce. So it’s important to ensure that the behavioural changes you encourage, promote a positive outcome. Bossidy explains that the first step is to clearly identify and communicate what results you are after. Then have a discussion about how those results are going to be reached. And finally, you reward people when their goals are reached. In the scenario where you and your team do not reach the end goal adequately, assess what happened and ask how can you learn for next time. It’s all about creating a culture of getting things done.

- **Actions**

  - Bossidy explains that behaviours are the outcome of beliefs being turned into action. The results are a direct result of the behaviours. When Bossidy talks about behaviour, he’s not referring to it on an individual level. He’s talking about collective behaviour from groups in corporate settings.


### Building block three: The job no leader should delegate
  
  - Bossidy explains that there is one job that no leader should ever delegate, and that’s ensuring that the right people are in the right job. It’s absolutely critical that leaders fully understand the importance of having the right people in the right roles. After all, it’s the people that are responsible for generating the results and outcomes. These are the people that make decisions every day and take actions toward either success or failure.

  - Bossidy explains that consistently successful businesses always have a leader who is dedicated to selecting the perfect people for the perfect roles. This isn’t a task that can be rushed or overlooked. It takes time and dedication when selecting the right employees but it is always going to be worth it.

  - **Development**

    - Further to selecting the right people, Bossidy emphasizes the importance of developing people within your company. Whether it be providing experiences, learning opportunities, feedback, coaching education or training. It is critical that everyone is always learning and developing. This encourages them to stay motivated, stay on track and better themselves and their work.


## THE THREE CORE PROCESSES OF EXECUTION

- Bossidy has identified three processes that should be at the core of execution. The people process, the strategy process, and the operation process. All are equally important.

### The people process
  
  - This process is all about connecting the people to the strategy and operations. People are at the core of any business, they are the ones that make decisions and create strategies. It’s absolutely critical that the right people understand how to translate the strategy into an operational reality.

  - Bossidy explains that by having an effective people process you will achieve three different things:

    - You’ll be able to evaluate the people you work with.
    - A framework will be provided to identify and develop leadership.
    - You’ll establish a leadership pipeline.

  - It’s important to create links between the people and the strategy and operations. Establishing this link will encourage people to remain focused and motivated and will keep everyone accountable.

### Leaders and those that don’t perform

- We’ve already discussed the idea of having a leadership pipeline, this should be dedicated to continuous improvement for the staff. By identifying milestones (both medium and long-term) you will have a system by which you can assess your staff. By assessing how quickly and effectively they meet their milestones you will be in a better position to understand who is better equipped to take on more responsibility.

- Bossidy explains that it’s inevitable that processes like this will bring attention to the non-performers. In some cases, people who have been promoted will be underperforming in their new role and need to be shifted back or eliminated altogether. Bossidy appreciates that this can be extremely difficult but it’s a necessary part of a leaders job.

- Bossidy explains that when the right people are in the right jobs it will become evidently clear. The way everyone works together seamlessly and delivers the desired results will be a clear identifier.


### The strategy process

- Bossidy’s strategy process is all about linking the people to operations. He explains that strategies all have a common, ground-level goal: to win over the customers and establish a competitive advantage. And this needs to be done within current financial restraints. So Bossidy asks the question, if it’s so straightforward, then why do strategies often fail?

- Bossidy believes that a strategic plan needs to be essentially an action plan. This plan needs to be clear and easily understood. Business leaders need to be able to understand what needs to be done in order to reach their goals. In order to establish an effective action plan, you first need to define and understand the critical issue. All good strategies have a critical issue that is the driving force behind it. Bossidy explains that once the plan has been established, you should develop it further by asking the following questions:

  - How good are the assumptions upon which the plan hinges?
  - What are the pluses and minuses of the alternatives?
  - Do you have the organizational capability to execute the plan?
  - What do you need to do in the near and medium terms to make the plan work in the long run?
  - Can you adapt the plan to rapid changes in the business environment?

### Strategic planning

- It’s absolutely essential that your strategy not only addresses the what but also the how. Without understanding how the strategy will be implemented you will face almost certain failure. Bossidy stresses the importance of defining six or less key concepts and actions behind any strategy. By being able to pinpoint these key concepts leaders will be able to understand and implement the strategy better. Even though a comprehensive strategy may be a lengthy document, you should be able to define the overall essence of the strategy on a single page.


### Questions and reviews

- Bossidy identifies some key things that a strategic plan must address:

  - Understanding existing customers and markets.
  - Identifying the best way to grow the business and make a profit.
  - What are some obstacles preventing growth?
  - Identify the competition.
  - Is the strategy realistic?
  - Does the strategy have realistic short-term and long-term milestones?
  - Identify each milestone.
  - Are there any issues that the business will face?
  - How is the business going to make money as a result of this strategy?
  - Is the profit going to be sustainable?

- Once the strategy has been finalized, the next step is to review it. Here’s what Bossidy recommends you consider for a review:

  - Raise any questions you have.
  - Revisit questions that have been asked previously. Have these been adequately answered?
  - Does the team understand the competition completely?
  - Does the organization have the capability to carry this strategy out?
  - Is there a clearly defined focus?
  - Has the right idea been chosen?
  - Can you clearly identify the link between people and operations?

### The operations process

- Bossidy’s operations process is all about linking the strategy to the people. As we’ve discussed, the strategy is designed to identify where the business is headed and how it’s getting there. The people process defines who is going to help the business get there. The final piece of the puzzle is the operation process, designed to define the road ahead, and the path the people can follow.

- Bossidy explains that an operating plan includes the path to reaching objectives including earnings, sales, margins, and cash flows. It also includes product launches, marketing plans, sales plans, manufacturing plans, and productivity plans.

- Everyone involved needs to be responsible for constructing the operations process. This isn’t purely the job of a leader. Bossidy identifies synchronization as a critical part of the execution process. It’s important to ensure that all parts of the organization have a common understanding and know who is responsible for what. By having synchronization within the organization you are much more likely to execute the strategy and reach your goals.

### Defining the operations process

- Setting realistic goals is the first step, and in order to do that, you need to make sound assumptions. Bossidy identifies this as a critical step and encourages you to spend time debating the assumptions. Once you’ve come to a clear conclusion, you can then move on to set realistic goals. The next step in the process is the building of the operations plan. You begin by setting targets. Followed by developing action plans, and short-term and long-term objectives. Also, spend time developing contingency plans. Finally, everyone needs to agree on the plan and ensure that it’s clear and straightforward. Bossidy encourages everyone to have follow-up measures in place to ensure that everyone is staying on track and working on the right steps and the right time. Keep accountability going throughout the process.


# Quotes

”It breaks long-term output into short-term targets. Meeting those here-and-now targets forces decisions to be made and integrated across the organization, both initially and in response to changes in business conditions. It puts reality behind the numbers.”

If it's on your mind, your mind isn't clear. Anything unfinished must be captured in a trusted system outside your mind.

"The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small, manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one."—Mark Twain

"There are only two problems in life:
(1) you know what you want, and you don’t know how to get it; and/or
(2) you don’t know what you want."

”Without execution, the breakthrough thinking breaks down, learning adds no value, people don’t meet their stretch goals, and the revolution stops dead in its tracks. What you get is a change for the worse, because failure drains the energy from your organisation. Repeated failure destroys it.”

”Quarterly reviews help keep plans up to date and reinforce synchronization. They also give a leader a good idea about which people are on top of their businesses, which ones aren’t, and what the latter need to do.”

”It’s the consistency of practice that develops expertise in appraising and choosing the right people. The people process begins with one-on-one assessments, but when developed and practiced as a total process, it becomes incredibly effective as an execution tool.”

”Tactics are central to execution, but execution is not tactics. Execution is fundamental to strategy and has to shape it. No worthwhile strategy can be planned without taking into account the organisation’s ability to execute it.”

”Leading for execution is not about micromanaging, or being “hands-on,” or disempowering people. Rather, it’s about active involvement—doing the things leaders should be doing in the first place.””To change a business’s culture, you need a set of processes— social operating mechanisms. These will change the beliefs and behaviour of people in ways that are directly linked to bottom-line results.”

”You cannot have an execution culture without robust dialogue. One that brings reality to the surface through openness, candor, and informality. Robust dialogue makes an organization effective in gathering information, understanding the information, and reshaping it to produce decisions. It fosters creativity—most innovations and inventions are incubated through robust dialogue. Ultimately, it creates a more competitive advantage and shareholder value.”

”When you interview, you have to create a full picture of the person in your mind based on things you can learn by probing them. Then you need to find out about their past and present accomplishments, how they think, and what drives their ambitions.”

”To be effective, a strategy has to be constructed and owned by those who will execute it, namely the line people. Staff people can help by collecting data and using analytical tools, but the business leaders must be in charge of developing the substance of the strategic plan.”
