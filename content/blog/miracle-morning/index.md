- **The 5-Step Snooze-Proof Wake Up Strategy**
  - Set Your Intentions Before Bed. Create genuine excitement for the next morning every night before bed

# How to Form Habits That Will Transform Your Life (In 30 Days)

- Divide the 30-day time frame necessary to implement a positive new habit (or get rid of an old, negative habit) into three 10-day phases.

- **[Days 1-10] Phase One: Unbearable**

  - The first 10 days of implementing any new habit, or ridding yourself of any old habit, can feel almost unbearable.

  - But this seemingly unbearable first 10 days is only "temporary." It only gets easier from here, and the reward is the ability to create everything you want for your life.

- **[Days 11-20] Phase Two: Uncomfortable**

  - The 2nd 10-day phase is considerably easier but still requires discipline and commitment on your part.

  - At this stage, it will still be tempting to fall back to your old behaviors. Stay committed.

- **[Days 21-30] Phase Three: Unstoppable**

  - The third 10-day phase is crucial to sustaining your new habit in the long term. The final 10 days are where you positively reinforce and associate pleasure with your new habit.

  - Phase Three is also where the actual transformation occurs, as your new habit becomes part of your identity. It transcends the space between something you’re trying and who you’re becoming. You start to see yourself as someone who lives the habit.

# misconception of success

- We believe success is impossible – So we criticize it.
- We believe success is mystical – So we search for it. (No Quick Fix)
- We believe success comes from luck – So we hope for it.
- We believe success is productivity – So we work for it.
- We believe success comes from an opportunity – So we wait for it.
- We believe success comes from leverage -So we power up for it.
- We believe success comes from connections – So we network for it.
- We believe success comes from recognition – So we strive for it.
- We believe success is an event – So we schedule it.
- The secret of your success is determined by your daily agenda. If you make a few key decisions and then manage them well in your daily agenda, you will succeed. You will never change your life until you change something you do daily.

- You will never change your life until you change something you do daily. You see, success doesn’t just suddenly occur one day in someone’s life. For that matter, neither does failure. Each is a process. Every day of your life is merely preparation for the next. What you become is the result of what you do today. In other words . . .YOU ARE PREPARING FOR SOMETHING.

- When it comes to change, there are really only three kinds of people:
  - Those who don’t know what to do
  - Those who know what to do but don’t do it
  - Those who know what to do and follow-through

- today is what's really matters.
  - it's too late for yesterday and we can't depend on tomorrow
  - 2 ingredients to make today great: decision and discipline
    - The most successful people in life are the ones who settle (**make decisions**) their critical issues early and manage them daily . The earlier you settle the critical issues in your life, the greater your potential for success.
    - discipline: the earlier we start, the greater the compound effect.
    - knowing that you're doing your preparation for the future today, gives you the confidence that all will be alright tomorrow.
# The 12 Daily Practices (Daily Dozen)

- pick 2 strength areas and one weakness and work on them for 60 days then re-evaluate and move on to something new if you have made significant progress.
- if the area still needs more work, remain focused on it for another 60 days.
- never work on more than 3 at a time.
- repeat the process until the daily become your second to nature.
- **make your day a masterpiece**

## Attitude: Choose and display the right attitudes daily.

- Your Attitude at the beginning of a task affects its outcome more than anything else. When you approach a task—especially an important one you don’t relish—fix your mind on the facts, not on your feelings. Focus on the possibilities, not the problems. That will put your attitude on the right track. And if it starts on the right track, it’s more likely to end up at the right destination.

- Your Attitude towards others often determines their attitude toward you.

- Your attitude is a choice. If you desire to **make your day a masterpiece**, then you need to have a great attitude. If it’s not good now, you need to change it. Make the decision.

- test your attitude when you spend time with others
  - do they walk away feeling better or worse?
  - do you clear the air, giving them a fresh perspective and positive encouragement, or do they go away feeling gloomy

- Your attitude affects how you start and finish your work. Attitude itself is contagious so check to see how others respond to you. If you want a better day, you need to change your attitude. Focus on the possibility instead of the problem. Take responsibility for your attitude, change the bad areas of your attitude and think and talk like the person you want to become. Once you've made a decision to have a positive attitude, it will not take care of itself. You need to attend to it daily by following these disciplines:
  - begin each day with an attitude check and watch for red flags
  - Recognize that your attitude needs adjustment.
  - Find something positive in everything, even in the midst of difficult situations
  - Eliminate negative words in your vocabulary by saying "I can, I will, I will make time, absolutely."
  - express gratitude to others daily.
  - Find positive people.

## Priorities: Determine and act on important priorities daily.

- **EVALUATE PRIORITIES DAILY**

- Priorities don’t stay put; you have to revisit them every day. Why? Because conditions continually change. So do methods of getting things done. Your values, once defined, are going to be steady. You will be able to rely on them. But how you carry them out needs to be flexible.

- According to a survey taken by Day-Timers, Inc., only one-third of American workers plan their daily schedules. And only 9 percent follow through and complete what they planned.6 If you want to be effective, you must be able to make the transition to planning.

- What if you only had 6 months left to live? What would you do? Priorities is about focus and concentration. It is recognizing that time is our most precious commodity, not money. Eliminate the non-essentials. Ask for feedback, take personality tests and evaluate your personal experiences. Think of the Pareto Principle by focusing on the 20% to get an 80% return in life. priorities help you to eliminate the nonessentials in life, to leave things undone. Ask yourself:
  - 1) What is required of me?
  - 2) What gives me the greatest return?
  - 3) What gives me the greatest reward?

- To set priorities, you need to:
  - 1) Evaluate priorities daily.
  - 2) Plan your time carefully.
  - 3) Follow your plan.
  - 4) Delegate whenever possible.
  - 5) Spend/invest your time wisely with right people daily.

## Health: Know and follow healthy guidelines daily.

- your health impacts you emotionally, spiritually and intellectually.

- **If you make decisions that are bad for your health, it will affect other areas of your life**. Young people tend to spend their health for wealth. Get enough exercise and eat well. **To take take care of your health, you need to**:
  - 1) Have a purpose worth living for.
  - 2) Do work you enjoy. so it won't wear you off.
  - 3) Find your own pace.
    - if you take a life more slowly than your energy level is capable of, you can become lazy
    - if you continually run at a pace faster than you are capable, you can burn out.
  - 4) Accept your personal worth. Eat right and exercise.
  - 5) Laugh. It helps handle stress.

## Family: Communicate with and care for my family daily.

- family life has profound impacts on how you live, it molds your character and the character or your family members, since your family is the primary environment, it influences the choices to make and the habits you cultivate everyday.

- while you can't do much about your ancestors, you can influence your descendants greatly.

- When you have a strong family life, you receive the message that you are loved, cared for, and important. The positive intake of love, affection and respect... gives you inner resources to deal with life more successfully.

- Family is safe-haven in storm. Family can be a source of stability and strength. But we often don’t give them enough of our time. **You can choose how long and how to spend time with them**. Put your family on your calendar first and don’t let them have the left overs in your schedule. Rewrite your own definition of success which is to be close and care for your family. Make them part of your non-negotiables in your schedule.
  - create and maintain family traditions
  - find ways to spend time together
  - express appreciation for each other
  - resolve conflict as quickly as possible.

## Thinking: Practice and develop good thinking daily.

- Success doesn’t come by accident. People don’t repeatedly stumble into achievement and then figure it out afterward. Whether you’re a doctor, a businessperson, a carpenter, a teacher, or a parent, your level of success will increase dramatically if you place high value on thinking. The greater your thinking, the greater your potential.

- Good thinking can increase all value and serve as assets. There are many types of thinking which includes: big picture thinking, focus thinking, creative thinking, realistic thinking, strategic thinking, possibility thinking, reflecting thinking, questioning popular thinking, shared thinking, unselfish thinking and bottom line thinking. You don’t need to be a master at all the thinking types but simply find people who can compensate the weak areas. **Everyday set aside a certain time to think, find thinking place and have a system/process that works for you. To think better, you need to**:
  - 1) Focus on the positive.
  - 2) Gather good input, capture your thoughts
  - 3) Spend time with good thinkers.

## Commitment: Make and keep proper commitments daily.

- Anyone who desires to achieve and become successful must be like a fine craftsman: committed to excellence. A great craftsman wants you to inspect his work, to look closely at its finest details. In contrast, sloppy people hide their work. And if anyone finds fault with it, shoddy workers find fault with their tools. Which are you most like? Excellence means doing your very best in everything, in every way. That kind of commitment will take you where halfhearted people will never go.

- In general, people approach daily commitment in one of two ways. They focus on the external or the internal. Those who focus on the external expect conditions to determine whether they keep their commitments. Because conditions are so transitory, their commitment level changes like the wind. In contrast, people who base their actions on the internal usually focus on their choices. Each choice is a crossroad, one that will either confirm or compromise their commitments.

- Expect that commitment will be a struggle but it is worth it. Focus on your choices and stick with it. This requires hard work and dedication. It help you going when life gets rough and the pain becomes great.

- don't rely on talent alone, add a strong work ethic to it.

- do what's right even when you don't feel like it.

## Finances: Earn and properly manage finances daily.

- Recognize that money won’t necessarily make you happy. Debt itself will likely to make you unhappy as well. And having financial margin gives you more options. You need to learn how to make money, remain grateful and not compare yourself to others. *The author personally lives by this rule: 10% to church and charity, 80% to living expenses and 10% to investments*. **When it comes to finance, ask yourself**:
  - 1) Am I preoccupied with things?
  - 2) Am I envious of others?
  - 3) Do I fight my personal values?
  - 4) Do I believe money will make me happy?
  - 5) Do I keep wanting more?
  - If you answered yes to one of these, then you need to do soul searching. Materialism is an obsession and mindset.

- Materialism is not about possession—it’s an obsession. I’ve known materialistic people with no money and nonmaterialistic people who possess lots of money.

- money is nothing but a tool that gives you options
  - focus on your financial game plan so that everyday you have more not fewer options to earn.
  - become a good earner
  - don't compare yourself to others
  - give as much as you can.
  - be grateful for what you have.

## Faith: Deepen and live out my faith daily.

- faith is trusting in advance what will only make sense in reverse.

- This gives strength and reduces stress. Studies have shown that people with faith are less likely to fall ill compared to non-believers. Everyone has a faith including both religious people and Atheists.
  - 1) Embrace the value of faith.
  - 2) Put God in the picture.
  - 3) Explore and deepen faith.
  - 4) associate with people of faith

- Faith not only can help you through a crisis, it can help you to approach life after the hard times with a whole new perspective. It can help you adopt an outlook of hope and courage through faith to face reality.

 - In the past, many people hoped that science would provide all the answers to life’s questions. But science cannot do that. Ironically, what is embraced as scientific fact changes from generation to generation. Just look at the way scientists have viewed our solar system. Ptolemy believed the earth was at its center. Copernicus asserted that the sun was at its center and the planets moved in circular orbits around it. Kepler proved that the orbits were elliptical. Today, scientists no longer argue the structure of the solar system, but ideas about how it was formed change continually.

## Relationships: Initiate and invest in solid relationships daily.

- Most people give away their relational energy on a first-come, first-served basis. Whoever gets their attention first gobbles up their time and relational energy. That’s why the squeaky wheels instead of the high producers at work consume so much attention and why so many people have nothing left to give when they get home from work.
  - When people don’t like you... they’ll try to hurt you.
  - If they can’t hurt you... they won’t help you.
  - If they have to help you... they won’t hope you succeed.
  - When they hope you don’t succeed... life’s victories feel hollow.

- If you desire to improve your understanding of people so that you can build positive relationships, then keep in mind the following truths about people—and actions you can take to bridge the gap often caused by them:
  - People are insecure . . . give them confidence.
  - People want to feel special . . . sincerely compliment them.
  - People desire a better tomorrow . . . show them hope.
  - People need to be understood . . . listen to them.
  - People are selfish . . . speak to their needs first.
  - People get emotionally low . . . encourage them.
  - People want to be associated with success . . . help them win.

- You will get far in life if you like people because the likable person always wins. Refer to "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie. Place a high value on people, expect the best from them, learn to understand them, listen to people, compliment them, listen to them, speak to their needs and encourage them to win.
  - give respect freely but expect to earn it from others.
  - add value to others without expect to receive value in return.
  - express love and appreciation often.
  - don't carry emotional baggage

## Generosity: Plan for and model generosity daily.

- True generosity isn’t a function of income—it begins with the heart. It’s about serving others and looking for ways to add value to them. That’s the way to achieve significance in your life.

- People love givers rather than self centered people. Giving turns your focus outward, adds values to others and actually helps the giver. You usually feel good after giving. So give others your money, time, and energy. Make yourself valuable but also value others.

- the purpose of life is not to win but to grow and share.

- to plan for and model generosity daily
  - don't wait for prosperity to become generous, change your heart.
  - find a reason to give every day.
  - find people to receive every day.

## Values: Embrace and practice good values daily.

- Discrepancies between values and practices create chaos in a person’s life. If you talk your values but neglect to walk them, then you will continually undermine your integrity and credibility. And that will happen even if you are unaware of your behavior and are not doing it intentionally.

- Values serve as an anchor, faithful friend and your north star. Many things in life will stand in the way of your values. 
  - **Everyday reflect and review your values**. Articulate and embrace your values everyday.
  - **See how you can apply and practice your values**. Compare your values to your practices daily.
  - live out your values regardless of your feelings

- values are the principles that guide your life. Your values are the deeply held beliefs that authentically describe your soul. They become a companion to you throughout your life and don't change.

## Growth: Desire and experience improvements daily.

- Often the most difficult part of the upward climb of growth is putting into practice what you learn. Yet that is where the true value is. The final test of any learning is always application. If what you’re learning can be used in some way to help and improve you or others, then it is worth the effort.

- We think that our bodies and minds will take care of itself automatically. We also think knowledge, information and experience are signs of growth. **But it’s about reflecting on experience and applying the knowledge learned**. This prevents stagnation in life. We also need to focus on internal change rather than external change. 
  - **Develop and follow a personal growth plan** by setting growth goals and putting yourself in an environment that supports growth. Keep asking yourself: **"what is my potential?**"
  - document what you learn and apply it.
  - learn to enjoy the journey.

# Quotes

"People without values are adrift on the ocean of life. When the waves come crashing down, they have no place to rest. Any big storm can threaten to put them under. Any current is liable to take them places they don’t want to go. However, when you have strong values, you have something that holds you steady, even when the weather gets nasty."

"Methods are many, Values are few. Methods always change, Values never do."

"Today, 2.5 percent of our income goes to charitable giving. That’s lower than it was during the Great Depression (2.9 percent). And 80 percent of Americans who earn at least $1 million a year leave nothing to charity in their wills."

"Greatness is not defined by what a person receives, but by what that person gives."

"You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of home and achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand." – U.S. President Woodrow Wilson

"If you have one true friend in life, you are very fortunate. If you have two real friends, it is highly unusual."

"Faith is to believe what we do not see; and the reward of this faith is to see what we believe."

"A faith that hasn’t been tested can’t be trusted"

"Having money may not make people happy, but owing money is sure to make them miserable"

"If you owe $1,000, you’re a piker. If you owe $100,000, you’re a businessman. If you owe $1 million, you’re a tycoon. If you owe $1 billion, you’re a magnate. If you owe $100 billion, you’re the government." – Rose Sand

"By simply changing the way you wake up in the morning, you can transform any area of your life, faster than you ever thought possible".

"We must realize that the real impact and consequence of each of our choices and actions—and even our thoughts—is monumental, because every single thought, choice, and action is determining who we are becoming, which will ultimately determine the quality of our lives.

"When the alarm clock goes off, and we hit the snooze button (the easy thing), most people mistakenly assume that this action is only affecting that moment. The reality is that this type of action is programming our subconscious mind with the instructions that it is okay for us to not follow through with the things we intended to do".

"Always remember that who you’re becoming is far more important than what you’re doing, and yet it is what you’re doing that is determining who you’re becoming".

"Accountability is the act of being responsible to someone else for some action or result".

"Here’s the problem: accountability was never something you and I asked for, but rather something that we endured as children, teens, and young adults. As it was forced upon us by adults, most of us unconsciously grew to resist and resent accountability altogether".

"Our levels of success will rarely exceed our level of personal development, because success is something we attract by who we become".

"Remember this truth: now matters more than any other time in your life, because it’s what you are doing today that is determining who you’re becoming, and who you’re becoming will always determine the quality and direction of your life".

"Every time you hit the snooze button, you’re in a state of resistance to your day, to your life, and to waking up and creating the life you say you want".

"It’s been said that nobody actually likes waking up early, but everyone loves the feeling of having woken up early.The first key to waking up is to remember [to set your intentions before bed]: Your first thought in the morning is usually the last thought you had before you went to bed".

"If you keep your alarm clock next to your bed, then you are still in a partial sleep-state when the alarm goes off, and it makes it much more difficult to wake yourself up".

"It’s crucial that you hydrate yourself first thing every morning. After 6-8 hours without water, you’ll naturally be mildly dehydrated, and dehydration causes fatigue".
