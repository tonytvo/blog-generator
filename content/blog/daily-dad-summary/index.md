# a little fellow follows you

- your children follow behind you. They see everything you do. If you go astray, so too will they.
- ![spy-wear-sneakers](./spy-wear-sneakers.jpg)

# never let them see you act like this

- However we conduct ourselves in front of our children—particularly at home, in private, they will come to see as normal. If we are rude or unkind to our spouse, they will assume that is an appropriate way to treat people they love. If we are anxious and overly worried, they will come to think that the world is a scary place that must be feared. If we behave unethically or
cynically, they too will begin to cheat and lie.

# Their Faults Are Your Faults

- Our kids have our virtues and our vices. That’s what makes this whole crazy parenting thing such a wonderful opportunity. Because we are here to help them become the best possible versions of themselves. One of the ways we do that is to help them become like us in all the good ways. But one of the other ways is to prevent them from becoming too much like us in all the bad ways.

- It can be an incredibly difficult balancing act if we aren’t honest or self-possessed, if we let our egos get in the way. We can’t let that happen. This is our chance, our time! To help them. To bolster them. To help them overcome flaws that maybe we never quite got over ourselves.

# Show Them How to Keep Their Cool

- Your kids will need them too. So show them. Show by example, not just with words. Show them, when you’ve been screwed over and it really hurts, that still your personal code of conduct matters more. Because it does. Because it will.


# Hang Their Pictures on Your Wall

- we can hang up pictures of our children and strive to make them proud, and this should inspire and fortify us when we have to make tough decisions for their future, for their safety, for their freedom
- it is our kids who compel us to do the right thing... because they are always watching


# They Learn from Home

- Those kids buckled in behind you—they are absorbing your example and assimilating the lessons that will shape them in the smallest and biggest of ways. From the kind of driver they are going to be to the kind of person they
are going to be. They are watching you as you go through the world. ***Right now***. They’re watching you break traffic laws, break promises. They hear you when you lie. They feel it when your actions don’t match your words.

- Kids learn from home. They learn in the car. They learn from Mom and Dad. You set the standard, so be the standard.

# Protect This Great Invention

- “The idea of childhood is one of the great inventions of the Renaissance,” he writes, because it allowed children to develop, to learn, to have a safe space to play and explore and discover themselves.

- Like any invention, childhood can disappear. How? With the disappearance of adulthood. Childhood, as both a social structure and a
psychological condition, works when things like maturity, responsibility, literacy, and critical thinking mark an adult. But when things like long-form writing and reading decline, the gap between child and adult shrinks; the line between them blurs and then dissolves.

- As parents, we have to protect this great invention. We have to increase the gap between childhood and adulthood. Let them be kids... but also make sure that you are being an adult. Be a leader. Be responsible. Be an example,
a model they have to strive toward. Let them see you with a book they can’t yet comprehend. Let them be around adult conversations they can’t quite understand. Let them see you working and sweating and providing.

- Let them see an adult—so they have something not just to look up to but to look forward to as well.

# Your Living Is the Teaching

- If you want to teach your kids, it’s not  going to be with words. It’s not going to
be with lectures. It’s going to be through showing them that you live according to the rules you set and the values you are trying to tell them are important.

# We Can Be That Gift

- What were the things that Marcus learned from Antoninus? He learned the importance of compassion, hard work, persistence, altruism, self-reliance, cheerfulness; keeping an open mind and listening to anyone who could contribute; taking responsibility and blame, and putting other people at ease; yielding the floor to experts and heeding their advice; knowing when to push something or someone and when to back off; being indifferent to superficial honors and treating people as they ***deserved to be treated.***

- It’s quite a list, isn’t it? These lessons impacted Marcus so deeply, he remembered them far into adulthood and recorded them for his own reference in what would become Meditations. What made the lessons so powerful was that they were *embodied* in Antoninus’s actions rather than written on some tablet or scroll.

- There is no better way to learn than from a role model. There is no better way to judge our progress than in constant company with the person we would most like to be one day.

# Don’t Talk About It. Be About It.

- We’re better off embodying our philosophy rather than talking about it. As the Stoics said, it’s a waste of time to speculate or argue about what makes a good man, a good athlete, a good teammate. Our job, they said, is to be one. This is how it goes, in sports, in life, and for parents. Sure, we can talk all we want. We can have great conversations. But what matters is what we do, who we are, how we act.

# Here’s How to Have Lasting Impact

- *To be in your children’s memories tomorrow, you have to be in their lives today.* - BARBARA JOHNSON

- That’s one person having an impact on three generations. When you think about it like that, it’s not an exaggeration to say that your grandparents quite literally changed the world. And they did it in the smallest of ways—with just a few conversations, with how they went to work every day, with the books they read in the evening and the manners they displayed at dinner. They did it in the conversations they had when their kids made mistakes. They did it in how they treated their neighbors and mowed their lawns and plowed their driveways.

# Where Do They Learn to Judge?

- It was a comment under your breath about your brother’s spending habits. It was a joke about a celebrity’s weight. It was a complaint about the way your neighbor parks in their driveway. It was the conversation between you and your spouse over dinner about what’s wrong with the other side, with them.

- You didn’t mean anything by it. You don’t really care. But your kids heard it. And they can read only your lips, not your mind.

- We want kids who are open-minded, who give people the benefit of the doubt. But are you showing yours what this looks like day to day? Sure, you’re not a bigot, but are you always kind? You would never say something cruel to someone’s face, so why are you saying it behind their back? Especially when your kids can hear you.

- The world needs less judgment, less bullying, fewer opinions, period. Can you start this trend at home? Can you teach your kids what that looks like, instead of letting the same old rumor mill spin round and round, grinding
their goodness to dust?

# If You Want Your Kids to Respect You

- Well, if you want your kids to respect you, be worthy of respect.

- Just think about it for a second: Why would they respect advice that you don’t live by? Why would they admire you when you’re not living up to your own potential? Why would they look up to you when you yourself are dealing (poorly) with self-esteem issues, when you have accepted the lies of impostor syndrome and allowed them to affect how you act as a parent?

- Get your stuff straight. Be the parent you know you can be—be the person you know you can be. The rest will follow. And if it doesn’t? Then at least you’ll be strong enough to deal with whatever comes.

# Don’t Let Your Kids Down

- How did Leonidas choose the three hundred warriors he would lead out to the Hot Gates to battle an overwhelming enemy? They were all “fathers of living sons,” according to  Plutarch. You might think it would have been the
opposite, that parents would be allowed to sit out a potential suicide mission - but that’s not how it worked in Sparta. These warriors were chosen because parents would never want to let their kids down. These fathers would fight most bravely, most fiercely, not only to protect what they had back at home but to protect the reputations of their family names, which might be all their children had left if they were to fall in battle. To abandon their comrades or behave in a cowardly way would be to risk great shame and the possibility of letting down the family that so looked up to them.

- Our kids are whom we should want to impress. They’re the ones we should never want to let down. They’re not only the ones we’re fighting for but also the ones whose standards - whose natural admiration and love - we should always be fighting to live up to.

# You Can’t Be a Hypocrite

- No child deserves that. At the very least, they deserve parents who live up to what they say. Give your kids that. Don’t be a hypocrite.

# Teach Them to Be Particular

- Not picky but particular. Not peculiar but particular. Be exacting. Get your facts straight. Do your job. Don’t let anyone or anything excuse you from it. Do it well.

- These are wonderful reminders to give our kids... but as always, it’s much more important that *they see us living these lessons.* Show them the difference between picky and particular, between factual and fatuous,
between compromise and *compromising your standards.*

- Show them what responsibility looks like. Show them how to be careful and how to always be prepared. Because someday you won’t be here, and they will have kids of their own who will need to learn these very ***particular*** lessons from them.

# Where Did You See That?

- Before you get mad, before you condemn their actions, just take them aside. Ask them, kindly and openly, a question that the bodybuilder Mark
Bell says he always asks his teenage kids: “Hey, when have you seen me do that?”

- This is a great question. Because it may well be that you have been inadvertently modeling behavior you find repugnant in others. And while
that’s no excuse for bad behavior, it’s useful to know if we’ve been tacitly condoning the wrong things to our kids. But if you haven’t, then they have even ***less*** of an excuse.

# Do the Things You Want Them to Do

- You have to be the kind of human being you
want your children to be. You have to do the things you want your kids to do. “I find this with parents all the time,” he said. “They want their kids to do things that they don’t do themselves.” He wants his kids to be readers, so he makes sure they see him reading. He wants them to explore different hobbies and  interests, so he makes sure they see him practicing an instrument or tinkering in a sketchbook. He wants them to work hard and find work they care about, so he makes sure they see him working in his studio. He wants them to treat others with respect and kindness, so he makes sure they see him giving their mother something he made for her.

- Who you are forms who they will be. So be who you want them to be. Do what you want them to do. It’s hard, but it’s the only way.

# What Are They Learning from How You Carry Yourself?

- What are your kids learning from how you carry yourself? Are you showing them, as Bruce’s dad did, how to be angry and bitter and lost? Or, as Bruce’s mom did, are you showing them how to be brave and tough and find their niche? Is your example calling them to be better or worse?

# They Are Always Listening

- The point is this: Kids are always watching, eyes, ears, and heart open. They absorb  everything. What will they hear? What is going to pour out of you that will soak into them? That’s the question.

# You Gotta Live Up to It

- As the billionaire Charles Koch once explained of the main lesson he learned from his father’s very hands-on parenting: you can’t
lecture your kids on anything you don’t live up to.

- You can’t tell your kids to respect others and then talk rudely to a customer service representative on the phone. You can’t tell them that it’s important to find and follow their passion and meanwhile work their entire
childhood at a job that pays well but makes you miserable. You can’t tell them that family is important if your actions don’t show it.

- You can’t lecture your kids. You have to live up to the lessons you want them to learn.

# When You Get Them to Listen...

- We have to remember that as parents we are always planting seeds. A comment here, a book we have them read there. A documentary we watch
together, an example we set, a person we introduce them to. When we get them to listen? When they really hear us? Wonderful things can grow out of that.

# How to Deter Them

- If you don’t want them to do something, if you want to deter them from some negative influence or bad choice, let your actions be the guide. Let your life both spur them and deter them. In this way, you can be their inspiration in any moment.

# Show Them What a Good Marriage Looks Like

- The point here is not to judge the Roosevelt marriage nor to insist that you must stay in your current one. It’s to remind you: Your kids learn about everything important from you. Including relationships. So what are you teaching them with yours? What are they seeing that you might be blind to? You have to show them what a good marriage looks like. You have to embody what healthy connections and equal partnerships look like, because the example you set will be their first and the most indelible.

# You Can Be a Parent Anywhere

- As with teaching and leadership and  philosophy, so too with parenting. You can be a parent anywhere. You can be a parent every minute of every day to anybody and everybody. You can be that parent in the same way that
Socrates taught—by example, by getting down to their level, by being open, and by adapting to the situation at hand.

# Let ’Em See You Work

- The problem? Well, where are your kids supposed to learn the importance of a work ethic? How are they supposed to know what a hardworking dad looks like if they never actually get to see it? How are they supposed to learn what work looks like at all?

- That is also your job. To be the example. There is an old Latin expression: A bove maiori discit arare minor. “The younger ox learns to plow from the elder.” That’s because the oxen would be harnessed together. Not only would
the kid get to see their mom or dad do what they did, but they’d be literally strapped into it together, to learn on the job.

- Obviously good boundaries are important. Obviously you don’t want your work life to overwhelm or interfere with your home life. But make sure that striving for this balance doesn’t accidentally deprive your kids of an
important example that will serve them  throughout their lives.

# Make Your Household First

- The point is: the place to apply your opinions about the way the world should work is first and foremost in the small world where you actually have some control. That is to say, at home. If you want to see a difference in the
world, then model that change and make a difference at home. You’ve got plenty to work with, plenty to fix, plenty to improve. Start there.

- Show your kids that change is possible. Show them why your opinions matter, and how they can make theirs matter. Let them witness the real
impact that comes from practicing what one preaches. Help them benefit from a focus on the practical instead of the theoretical, the actual instead of the hypothetical.

- ***Start now.***

# They Do Most of It

- We do our best to set a good example. They do most of the work.

- As hard as our job is, they have it way harder. Don’t you remember being ten? Or fifteen? Or twenty? You don’t remember being a kid... probably because you were so busy literally developing a brain. So yes, it’s amazing to see what they’ve become and what they’ve done.

- Just remember that they get the credit (and you get the blame).

# You Don’t Stop Teaching Your Kids

- We never stop teaching our kids. And though what we are doing right now may not be resonating with them, it can teach them something in the future.

- Keep doing what needs to be done. Embody what you want your kids to be. Keep growing. Keep being the example they can follow. Keep teaching
them, implicitly and explicitly.

# There Is No Substitute for Your Love

- In his beautiful and vulnerable memoir, Bruce Springsteen writes that his father said fewer than a thousand words to him throughout his entire childhood. Maybe “you’re not greeted with love and affection,” he writes, because “you haven’t earned it.” So for decades, Bruce tried anything to earn his father’s love.

- It’s poignant, haunting, and heartbreaking. From the outside, it looked like Bruce Springsteen had everything; on the inside, he felt like he had nothing. It’s evidence of our power as parents. No amount of money or celebrity or
awards can substitute for your love. That’s all they want.

# You Can’t Say These Words Enough

- your kids shrug when you say it. It feels weird saying it in public - cliché, lame, vulnerable. You don’t want to embarrass them. Or bother them. Or interrupt. Plus, they know how you feel, right? You’ve said it a thousand times before at home.

- We have a million reasons not to say these words, but all of these reasons are wrong because it’s impossible to say them enough:
  - I love you.
  - I’m proud of you.
  - It’s you I like.
  - You are special.
  - You are enough.
  - You’re the most important thing in the world to me.

- At the end of your life, do you think, for one second, that you will kick yourself for saying any of those words too much? Or is it more likely that you’ll wish you’d said those things more? Because it would absolutely kill you if you thought for one second that they might not know, that they might not feel in their hearts, how much you loved them, how proud you were of them, how nothing—not success, money, or lack of either—could change what they meant to you from the moment they were born.

- Life is full of risks. This is one gamble you don’t need to take. So say it. Tell them how you feel. Tell them that you love them. Say it again and again and again. 

- It’s impossible to do it too much... but you might as well try.

# Love without End. Amen.

- Parental love is not something that is dispensed only when things are going easily with your kids. When they listen. When they conform to your expectations. Expressions of love are not just for when they succeed or when everything is going well in your life or in your job.

- Not every now and then but always. Without end. Unconditionally. Even when they hit their siblings, when they lie about a test, when they don’t want to eat their vegetables, when they want to quit something you paid a lot of money for, when they’ve acted in a way contrary to the values you’ve tried to instill in them.

- Even if this kind of love isn’t something you got as a kid. Even if it seems clouded when you’re struggling or difficult to express when you’re pissed off. Even when they take you for granted and make things so hard on you, you have to show them that you love them.

- ***It’s a love without end, amen.***

# Love Is About Service

- Parenting is being there, literally. It’s about being of service, literally. Driving them around. Tying their shoes. Coming over to do the dishes and laundry after they’ve come home from the hospital with their own newborn. Holding their hair back as they throw up from chemo treatments. It doesn’t matter how old they are, or you are; that’s what we’re here for. That’s what we do.

- We ask them the question that Tom Hanks has described asking his own children: “ ‘What do you need me to do?’ You offer up that to them. ‘I will do anything I can possibly do in order to keep you safe.’ That’s it. Offer that up and then just love them.”

- That is love. It’s what your job is. You’re here to serve.

# Make Sure They Know That They Are Plenty

- It’s a sobering reminder to all parents: the feeling of deficiency is far worse than any potential deprivation. So make sure your kids know that they are enough, that they are plenty, that you have loved them from the moment they were born. And make sure you remember that there is nothing they have to do to earn this love. There’s nothing they must accomplish to deserve tenderness and affection.

- They are good enough. The talents, the interests, the goals they have, are enough.

# It Takes Discipline

- So often important and talented people use their work and their talent as an excuse to neglect their obligations as parents. But di Prima was exactly right to see them both as a matter of discipline and commitment. The idea that anything (or anyone) is improved by neglecting one part of their life for another is nonsense. But the opposite is true—by keeping your word to yourself, to your children, you are strengthening an important muscle. By being disciplined and protective of your personal life, you are being protective and dedicated to your professional life.

- Don’t let anyone tell you differently. Don’t let anyone judge you for that.

# Wherever They Are, You Are Too

- Your kids are going to make choices that scare you. People are going to doubt them. People are going to criticize them. Maybe you yourself doubt the wisdom of their choices. And?

- ***Where they are, you must be too.***

- Love your kids. Root for them. Support them. Fight for them and fight with them. Be beside them and behind them. Wherever they are.

# They Don’t Have to Make You Proud

- We want this to motivate them. We use it, oftentimes unconsciously, to hold them accountable. But is this the way it should go? Doesn’t it sort of imply that they owe us something? That our support is not unconditional or implicit? That if they don’t score a goal or make the dean’s list or land a summer internship, we are therefore not proud?

- Our kids don’t owe us anything. After all, they didn’t ask to be here. It is we who are obligated to them, by virtue of our choice to bring them into this world.

# Here’s How to Tie Your Family Together

- You want your kids to really listen, to buy in. You want them around, you want them to come to you. You want them to respect your rules and embody your values. You want them to do what they’re supposed to do, the things that will make them successful.
- *So how do you get them to do those things?*

- Well, for most parents, the answer is to default to the easiest and most primal form of leadership: force. It’s got a simple logic to it. You make them do it - *because I’m bigger than you, because I can take away the TV remote,
because I said so*. And it seems like it works... for a while. Perhaps you remember how this worked from your own childhood. Eventually, the strategy falls apart over time. In the end, it turns out to be counterproductive.

- Okay. Then listen to Lincoln. “Love is the chain whereby to bind a child to its parent.”

# When They Wander Back...

- Your kids may never demand their share of the estate, but they will stray. They will act out. They will try to  establish their independence. They will get themselves into trouble. As parents, we have to accept that, and accept them
all the same. We have to take them back. We have to give them what they need. And when they wander back, we have to make sure they’re always met not with reproach or “I told you so” but with affection and understanding.

# There’s a Reason You’re So Raw

- You’re raw because having kids has opened you up. “I wasn’t emotionally prepared for parenthood,” the comedian and author Michael Ian Black writes, “after spending the thirty previous years in a cauterized emotional state.”
Parenthood forces you to engage the world in a more active way. It forces you to engage with yourself and your own emotions in an active way. Was it easier to go through the world closed off and cynical? Is there something tribal and reassuring about focusing on yourself and your problems and
placing the blame for those things elsewhere, on those other people?

- Of course. But that’s less and less possible these days. This parenting thing has changed you. It’s made you see that it’s all connected, that we’re all connected. It’s made you better.

# Love the Kid You Have

- If there were a list of things you never wanted your kids to think or feel, those responses—which Jessica says get emailed to her almost every day—are probably right at the top of the list. No kid should feel like their dad wants them to be someone else, to be something different. No kid should feel that they are a disappointment. They should know that they are special for who they are, that they make the world—and your life - better just by being in it.

- Your kids need to be seen. They need to be heard. They need to be loved. They need to be known. For who they are, for what they choose to be. Not for who or what you want them to become.

- That’s all they really want from us. And they deserve to have it. So you better give it to them. Starting today and for the rest of their lives.

# You Can Always Give Them This

- The good news is that there are some things you can always give them that, when others try to offer them to your kids, will never measure up to yours. These are things that are always possible to give, always within your reach: your attention, your understanding, and your love.

- No matter what happens, no matter how rich or poor you are, no matter what mistakes you make or they make, no matter how powerful or powerless you are, you can always give them those things. In fact, you must always give
them. Because, in the end, those are more important than all the other things you can and will do for them. Love and understanding, especially, are the only things that truly matter, because they last even beyond your death. Their
impact is going to be one of the primary forces that shape the adult your child becomes.

- And if you think about it, the only thing they’ll truly (and rightfully) resent you for, all else being equal, is if you know these things are true and still you fail to provide them.

# The Greatest Thing You Can Do

- The best thing you can do for your kids is love the person who brought them into this world. The best thing you can do for your kids is love the person you are parenting them with. Even if you are no longer with that person, or if that person has deeply hurt or even betrayed you, you must love the person responsible for a good chunk of your kids’ DNA or identity. You must love who your kids love—that’s how they’ll know that they are loved.

# This Is What They Most Want

- Don’t we ourselves want attention and admiration? In our jobs? In our communities? In our marriages? Why wouldn’t our kids want the same things in their young, fragile lives? And who could it possibly be more meaningful
to come from than us?

- It’s hard to be a kid. They’re overwhelmed. They doubt themselves. They wonder where they fit in, whether they matter. It’s our job to help them with this. To let them know that they are loved, that they are special, that they are enough. To give them the attention and admiration they deserve.

# Keep the Main Thing the Main Thing

- ***Most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquility. Ask yourself at every moment, “Is this necessary?”*** - MARCUS AURELIUS

- There’s a wonderful little expression: ***The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.***

- Every family, every person, has a different main thing, of course. But if we could generalize, the main thing for us parents is to **raise well-adjusted, self-reliant, decent, happy kids.** ***The main thing is not college. The main thing is not making partner at our law firm. The main thing is not to have a clean house. The main thing is not to win some competition with other parents. The main thing is not grades, it is not following in your footsteps, it is not being captain of the football team or an expert cello player***. 

- ***The main thing is for them to be healthy, to be prepared for life, to have good values, to have a good sense of who they are and what they want to spend their life doing. The main, main, main, main thing is to love them and for them to feel loved.***

# Let Them Wonder If You Know

- Of course parent knew! A parent always does! But she didn’t say a word. She just did what she needed to do, caring not only about her son’s well-being but also for his feelings and his pride.

- When our kids need help, our only job is to provide it. To *help*, not *lecture*. To be of service, never to humiliate. This is how you create the kind of relationship Floyd and his mother had—the kind where your kids know
they can always come home for help at any time, day or night.

# How to Convince Them

- Our kids are going to do stuff we disagree with, but very rarely - especially as they get older—will we be able to convince them of this by force or fiat. We have to be understanding. We have to be patient... maybe
even a little bit sneaky. We have to give them advice and the tools to make sense of that advice, because ultimately they are the ones who have to figure out the right decision for themselves. And we have to make sure they know that no matter what they decide, we love them.
