# Scope and Limits of Security Analysis
- common obstacles to analyst
  - inadequate or incorrect data
  - uncertainties of future
  - irrational behavior of the market
  - "in the short term the market is a voting machine, but in the long term it tracks value"
- 3 functions of analysis
  - **Descriptive function** 
    - collecting important facts and presenting them in an understandable manner. This would reveal:
      - reveal strong and weak points
      - make comparisons with similar issues
      - appraise for future performance
  - **Selective Function**
    - express specific judgement, by determining whether an issue should be bought, held, sold, etc.
    - common approach is to analyze company's ability to earn and make payments to the investor.
    - Intrinsic value is the estimated valuation based on the analyst's opinion of the intrinsic worth of the security from different source of information such as assets, earnings, dividends, growth, management, etc...
      - value of a business can be analyzed from the perspective of multiple earnings (P/E ratio, "earnings power"). It is cautioned that valuing a business solely from the earnings power is very risky and uncharacteristic of wise analyst.
  - **Critical Function**
    - "Analytical judgments are reached by applying standards to facts"
    - should seek adequate protective provisions (margin of safety) in bonds and preferred stocks.
    - must be alert to the misrepresentation by accountants and management bad practices.

# Themes of value investing
- Focusing on the differences between investing and speculating
  - failure to distinguish one from another has led to tragedies.
  - investments are bonds, outright purchases, permanent holding, for income, in safe securities.
  - speculations are stocks, purchases on margin, for a "quick turn", for profit, in risky issues.
  - specific standards have to be applied to give meaning to the term "safety"
  - an investment operation promises the safety of the principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.
  - an investment operation is one that can be justified on both qualitative and quantitative grounds.
  - investment is founded on the past and present, speculation relies on the future to improve.
  - for the investor, the future is to be guarded against rather than profit from.
  - for the speculator, he anticipates the future will be better than the past.
  - "intelligent speculation" is taking a measured risk that seems justified after analysis
  - "unintelligent speculation" is taking a risk without adequate examination of the situation
  - safety is measured in terms of the ability of the issuer to meet obligations
    - that ability should be assessed in terms of depression, not prosperity
  - lack of safety is not compensated by high dividends
  - Avoiding trouble is better than seeking protection after it occurs.
  - a sound investment must be able to withstand adversity. Enterprises that have withstood adversity may be favored by investors.
  - investment for profit, where growth is generally expected, the price is rarely reasonable.
  - the investor of small means may opt to step out of his role and become a speculator. He may also opt to regret his actions.
- Analysis skills
  - The term analysis indicates a scientific and methodical study of facts, which results in logical conclusions. But investment is not an exact science, and success derives in part from personal skills and chance.
  - analytical judgments are reached by applying standards to facts
  - analyst must preserve a sense of proportion, analyze what matters and ignore what trivial
