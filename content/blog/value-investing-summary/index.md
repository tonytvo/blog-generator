# Scope and Limits of Security Analysis
- common obstacles to analyst
  - inadequate or incorrect data
  - uncertainties of future
  - irrational behavior of the market
  - "in the short term the market is a voting machine, but in the long term it tracks value"
- 3 functions of analysis
  - **Descriptive function** 
    - collecting important facts and presenting them in an understandable manner. This would reveal:
      - reveal strong and weak points
      - make comparisons with similar issues
      - appraise for future performance
  - **Selective Function**
    - express specific judgement, by determining whether an issue should be bought, held, sold, etc.
    - common approach is to analyze company's ability to earn and make payments to the investor.
    - Intrinsic value is the estimated valuation based on the analyst's opinion of the intrinsic worth of the security from different source of information such as assets, earnings, dividends, growth, management, etc...
      - value of a business can be analyzed from the perspective of multiple earnings (P/E ratio, "earnings power"). It is cautioned that valuing a business solely from the earnings power is very risky and uncharacteristic of wise analyst.
  - **Critical Function**
    - "Analytical judgments are reached by applying standards to facts"
    - should seek adequate protective provisions (margin of safety) in bonds and preferred stocks.
    - must be alert to the misrepresentation by accountants and management bad practices.

# Themes of value investing
- Focusing on the differences between investing and speculating
  - failure to distinguish one from another has led to tragedies.
  - investments are bonds, outright purchases, permanent holding, for income, in safe securities.
  - speculations are stocks, purchases on margin, for a "quick turn", for profit, in risky issues.
  - specific standards have to be applied to give meaning to the term "safety"
  - an investment operation promises the safety of the principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.
  - an investment operation is one that can be justified on both qualitative and quantitative grounds.
  - investment is founded on the past and present, speculation relies on the future to improve.
  - for the investor, the future is to be guarded against rather than profit from.
  - for the speculator, he anticipates the future will be better than the past.
  - "intelligent speculation" is taking a measured risk that seems justified after analysis
  - "unintelligent speculation" is taking a risk without adequate examination of the situation
  - safety is measured in terms of the ability of the issuer to meet obligations
    - that ability should be assessed in terms of depression, not prosperity
  - lack of safety is not compensated by high dividends
  - Avoiding trouble is better than seeking protection after it occurs.
  - a sound investment must be able to withstand adversity. Enterprises that have withstood adversity may be favored by investors.
  - investment for profit, where growth is generally expected, the price is rarely reasonable.
  - the investor of small means may opt to step out of his role and become a speculator. He may also opt to regret his actions.
- Analysis skills
  - The term analysis indicates a scientific and methodical study of facts, which results in logical conclusions. But investment is not an exact science, and success derives in part from personal skills and chance.
  - analytical judgments are reached by applying standards to facts
  - analyst must preserve a sense of proportion, analyze what matters and ignore what trivial
truth seeker
- there are 3 types of variables used to rank stocks: fundamental, growth, and profitability.
- the most common variables used to select stocks are those that relate the price of the shares to some fundamental company information: share price to earnings, share price to cash flow, share price to book value, share price to sales, or share price to dividends.

# investment philosophy
- focuses on individual companies, rather than macro-economic factors
- invests in companies with sustainable competitive advantages
- prefers becoming an expert on a few companies over major diversification
- does not believe in technical analysis
- bases his investment decisions on the operational performance of the underlying businesses
- holds on to stocks for an extremely long period
- minimizes risks by requiring a significant margin of safety before investing.
- sticks to the companies within the "circle of competence"
- contrarian, always going against the crowd and buying at the point of maximum pessimism.
- global investment approach: looks for interesting stocks in every country, but preferably countries with limited inflation, high economical growth, and a movement toward liberalization and privatization.
- prefers a concentrated portfolio with around 10-12 stocks
- be patience and keep an open-mind and a skeptical attitude towards conventional wisdom.
- first step is to look for stocks trading below 2/3rd of net current asset value (NCAV)
- prefers companies which pay dividends
- earnings should be growing
- price/earnings ratio should be lower than 15 over the past 3 years.
- avoid technical analysis
- emphasizes the importance of honest, able management, and shareholder friendly
- should not follow the masses, but instead have patience and think for yourself.
- asking questions to customers, employees, competitors, analysts, suppliers and management to find out more about the competitive position of a company and its management.
- only sells when a company starts experiencing issues with its business model, competitive positioning, or management.
- looks for low-risk, high-uncertainty opportunities with a significant upside potential.
- use value line investment survey to find attractive stocks.
- it is futile to predict interest rates and where the economy is heading
- formulates exactly why the stock should be bought before actually buying it.
- use several valuation methods simultaneously, since no method is perfect and it is impossible to precisely calculate the intrinsic value of a company.
- you should find out not only if an asset is undervalued, but also why it is undervalued.

# Quotes

"Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful"

"If you're analyzing an unstable business, then your analysis might be worthless"

"In the short term the market is a voting machine, but in the long term it tracks value"

"A good rule of thumb is to limit the cost of your transaction to no more than 1 percent of the amount of stock you’re buying. For example if a trade costs $9.99 to execute you should buy at least $1,000 worth of stock."

"The best predictor of a mutual fund’s future investment return is not the number of Morningstar stars it receives, but how low its expense ratio is."

"Trying to beat the market is a fool’s errand."

"We want the business to be one (a) that we understand; (b) with favorable long-term prospects; (c) operated by honest and competent people; (d) available at a very attractive price."

"price is what you pay, value is what you get"

once you adopt a value-investment strategy, any other investment behavior starts to seem like gambling.
