    - impacted by:
      -  the strike price and share price
      -  time remaining until expiration
   -  the deeper in the money, the higher the delta. Inverse, the father out of the money, the lower delta.
   -  as back door predicting mechanism
      -  not very accurate (esp. longer dated)
      -  delta 0.5 = 50-50 chance
      -  delta 0.9 = strong likelihood to be in the money (ITM)

  - theta: sensitivity to time. The amount of daily time decay in the price of option assuming nothing else changes.
  - vega: sensitivity to volatility changes. The amount of change to the option for each percentage unit change in the underlying security's volatility
  - rho: sensitivity to interest rates. The amount of change to the option for each percentage unit change in interest rates.
