Zoning and development: The forum emphasized the importance of understanding zoning changes and upcoming infrastructure projects (e.g., new CTrain routes) that can impact long-term investment value. Ogden, for example, is expected to see significant appreciation as zoning changes allow for more in-fill developments, and the CTrain extension improves accessibility.
