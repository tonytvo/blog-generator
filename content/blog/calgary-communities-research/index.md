- **Strategy:**
  - Buy and Hold
    - Strategy: Purchase properties to rent out while holding them for long-term appreciation.

    - Rental Income: Given its stable housing market and reasonable property prices, buy-and-hold investors can generate consistent rental income, particularly with single-family homes and townhomes.
  - Secondary Suite Conversions
    - Strategy: Converting single-family homes into properties with secondary rental suites.
    - Why it works: Many older homes in Thorncliffe sit on large lots, which may offer opportunities to develop legal basement or garage suites. This strategy can help maximize rental income from a single property, making the investment more profitable.
    - Target Tenants: This strategy could appeal to families or professionals looking for affordable housing options, and the additional rental unit can diversify income streams.
  - Renovation and Flipping
    - Strategy: Buying older homes, renovating them, and selling for a profit.
    - Why it works: Many homes in Thorncliffe were built between the 1950s and 1980s, making them prime candidates for renovation. Upgrading these homes with modern finishes and energy-efficient improvements can appeal to buyers looking for move-in-ready homes.
    - Target Buyers: First-time homebuyers or families looking for affordable, updated homes in a mature neighborhood.
  - Infill Development
    - Strategy: Purchasing larger lots and developing new infill properties.

    - Potential Returns: Infill projects can command premium prices, especially as demand for newer, energy-efficient homes grows in mature neighborhoods.
  - Rent-to-Own (Lease Option)
    - Strategy: Offering rent-to-own options to tenants.
    - Why it works: Thorncliffe’s relatively affordable home prices make it an attractive area for buyers who may not yet qualify for a mortgage but are looking for a pathway to homeownership. Investors can structure rent-to-own deals to attract tenants who eventually want to buy the property.
    - Benefits: This strategy provides consistent rental income with the potential to sell the property to the tenant in the future, locking in an exit strategy early on.
  - Multi-Family Investment
    - Strategy: Investing in or converting homes into multi-family or duplex properties.
    - Why it works: If zoning permits, creating multi-family units can provide higher cash flow per property. Thorncliffe’s demographic mix of families, professionals, and retirees can support demand for duplexes or multi-family units.

  - Buy and Hold
    - Strategy: Purchase properties to rent out and hold for long-term appreciation.
    - Why it works: Ogden is an established neighborhood with relatively affordable home prices, making it attractive for investors.

    - Potential Returns: Infill projects can help meet the demand for modern, affordable homes, and new developments can attract buyers or renters looking for housing close to transportation routes.
  - Multi-Family Investment
    - Strategy: Investing in multi-family or small apartment buildings.
    - Why it works: Ogden has a mix of single-family homes and small multi-family properties. Investors can acquire or develop multi-family buildings to meet the demand from working-class families and individuals who prefer rental accommodations. The neighborhood’s industrial employment centers provide a steady tenant base.
    - Rental Demand: The close proximity to industrial areas and major transportation routes ensures a reliable demand for rental units.
  - Land Banking
    - Strategy: Purchasing vacant or underdeveloped land for future appreciation and development.
    - Why it works: As the Green Line LRT project progresses and infrastructure improves, vacant land or older properties in Ogden may appreciate significantly. Investors can hold onto land or properties for future development when the area’s demand increases.
  - Rent-to-Own (Lease Option)
    - Strategy: Offering properties as rent-to-own options to tenants.
    - Why it works: Ogden is an affordable neighborhood, which can attract tenants who are not yet ready to buy but are interested in homeownership.

  - Investing in affordable properties for long-term rental income, capitalizing on steady demand for budget-friendly housing.

- **Value-Add Renovations:**
  - Purchasing older homes in need of updates, renovating to modern standards to increase property value and attract higher-paying tenants.

- **Secondary Suites:**
  - Developing legal secondary suites in properties with appropriate zoning to maximize rental income and cater to multi-family tenants.

- **Affordable Housing Focus:**
  - Targeting investments that provide affordable rental options, aligning with the neighborhood's demographic and maintaining high occupancy rates.
