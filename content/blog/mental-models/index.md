    - considering alternative perspectives (what might others think? how do I know I'm correct?)
    - examining consequences and implications (what if I am wrong? what are the consequences if I am?)
    - questioning the original questions (why did I think that? was I correct? what conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?)
    - the process stops you from relying on your gut and limits strong emotional responses. This process helps you build something that lasts.
