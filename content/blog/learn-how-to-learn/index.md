# Why?
  - reading/learning can be a "priceless opportunity to furnish your mind and enrich the quality of your life"
  - read/learn for better understanding of others and myself
  - read/learn to make fewer mistakes.
  - read/learn to increase knowledge
  - read/learn to find meaning
  - read/learn improves vocabulary, focus, memory and imagination
  - Odds are that no matter what you're working on, someone somewhere, who is smarter than you, has probably thought about your problem and put it into a book.
  - there are few things that hold us back and rob us our productivity, prosperity, positivity and peace of mind and reduce our capacity to think, focus, learn, grow, and be fully human
    - drowning in data and rapid change, we long for strategies and tools to regain some semblance of productivity, performance, and peace of mind
    - the fleeting ping of digital dopamine pleasure replaces our ability to sustain the attention necessary for deep relationships, deep learning or deep work
    - overuse of digital technology results in the breakdown of cognitive abilities. Short-term memory pathways will start to deteriorate from underuse if we overuse technology.
    - we're letting technology do much of our critical thinking and reasoning for us.
