# Why?
  - reading can be a "priceless opportunity to furnish your mind and enrich the quality of your life"
  - I read for better understanding of others and myself
  - I read to make fewer mistakes.
  - I read to increase knowledge
  - I read to find meaning
  - Odds are that no matter what you're working on, someone somewhere, who is smarter than you, has probably thought about your problem and put it into a book.

# Overview

  ## the top 12 most useful & universal mental models

![top 12 most useful & universal mental models](./mental-models-infographic.jpg)

  ## two types of knowledge: max planck/chauffeur test
  - [two types of knowledge](https://fs.blog/two-types-of-knowledge/)
  - The first type of knowledge is real, it can't be bought. It can't be copied. If you want real knowledge you need to earn it. The second type of knowledge is copied. On the surface you know the answer but you lack the understanding to show your work.
  - real knowledge comes from ability to explain things without using jargon or vague terms, understand how things interact and predict the consequences.
  - distinguish between people who've done the work and those who haven't. The ones who have will pass the [Batesian Mimicry Test](https://fs.blog/batesian-mimicry/)


# FAST method for learning anything

- **F - Forget**.
  - You need to forget what you know about the subject, forget situational things that are not urgent, and temporarily forget your limitations.
  - start with a beginner's mind
- **A - Active**.
  - learning is not a spectator sport. Practice, take notes or ask questions
  - your superbrain works not by consuming information, but by creating and co-creating it.
- **S - State**. All learning is state dependant
  - be fully present and don't focus on other things that are not urgent
  - changing your physiology, changes your psychology.
  - as your body moves, your brain grooves
- **T - Teach.**
  - when you teach something to someone, you get to learn it twice.
  - learn with the intention of teaching somebody specific.
  - Feynman technique
    - pretend to teach a concept you want to learn about to a student in the sixth grade
    - identify gaps in your explanation. Go back to the source material to better understand it.
    - organize and simplify
    - transmit (optional)
      - the ultimate test of your knowledge is your capacity to convey it to another.
      - attempt to transmit the material to at least 1 person who isn't that familiar with it.


# How we learn to read
- there's difference between reading for understanding and reading for information
  - lots of people confuse knowing the name of something with understanding. While great for exercising your memory, the regurgitation of facts without solid understanding and context gains you little in the real world.
  - **anything easily digested is reading for information.**
- [work required to have an opinion](https://fs.blog/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/)
- if you're a knowledge worker, you're paid to use your brain, so it's in your best interest to make that brain as efficient as possible.
- The number of pages you read is not as important as the fact you're enjoying it.
- **skim a lot of books, read a few. Immediately re-read the best ones twice**
  - when you lose interest give it 5 more pages. Then skim the next chapter. If you're still not interested, put it down. It's the authors job to keep your attention
    
# Finding more time to read
  - **find time to read boils down to choices about how you allocate your time.**
  - **reading isn't something to be done once a week to check a box; it's something to do every day**.
  - **What gets in the way of reading?**
    - avoid time commuting
    - avoid time shopping
    - avoid watching TV
    - combine reading with idle activities, waiting for a bus, waiting for a taxi, on the train, on the plane, waiting for your flight.
    - **what I read depends on situation**
      - if there's on few minutes, read something simple, rather disposable, easily digested.
      - early in the evening, around 8-9, read something without interruption
      - before going to bed, read something light or something requiring more thought so I can ponder an idea while I'm falling asleep.
      - when I'm not reading, I'm trying to think about what I have just read (like waiting in the checkout line at the grocery store)

# System for remembering what you learn
  - Mark up the book while reading it. Questions, thoughts. And, more important connections to other ideas.
  - at the end of each chapter, without looking back, write some notes on the main points/arguments/take-away. Then look back through the chapter and write down anything you missed.
  - specifically note anything that was in the chapter that you can apply somewhere else
  - summary and review the notes periodically
  - [blank sheet](#blank-sheet) technique
  - [conventional notes](#conventional-notes) technique

# Note taking
  ## audio journal
  - need to do more research in this
  ## Blank sheet
  - before you start reading a new book, take out a blank sheet of paper. write down what you know about the subject you're about to read - a mind map if you will
  - after you're done a reading session, spend a few minutes adding to the map (I use a different color ink)
  - before you start your next reading session, review the mind map(I use mind as a bookmark sometimes)
  - put these mind maps in a binder, and periodically review them.
  - the blank sheet primes your brain for what you're about to read and shows you what you're learning

  ## conventional notes
  - you bought this thing, it's your property, you need to [write in the margins](https://fs.blog/marginalia/)
  - at the end of each chapter write a few bullet points that summarize the main idea or specific points. Use your own words and not the authors. Try and connect it to something in your life - a memory or another idea. Also, make note any unanswered questions you had while reading.
  - when you're done the book, put it down for a week
  - pick up the book again and go through all your notes. In a lot of cases, reading your notes will be as good as reading the book again.
  - writing is the process by which we often discover we don't know what we're talking about.
   
# Mental models
## Circle of competence
- [circle of competence](https://fs.blog/circle-of-competence/)
  - each of us, through experience or study, has built up useful knowledge on certain areas of the world. Some areas are understood by most of us, while some areas require a lot more specialty to evaluate
  - that basic knowledge, along with some understanding of accounting and a little bit of study, would enable one to evaluate and invest in any number of restaurants and restaurant chains, public or private.
  - where should we devote our limited time in life, to achieve the most success? define the perimeter of your circle of competence, and operate inside. Over time, work to expand that circle but never fool yourself about where it stands today, and never be afraid to say "I don't know"
  - you know when to follow the rules and when they'll get you in trouble.

## Work required to have an opinion
- you have to do the reading, you have to talk to competent people and understand their arguments
- you have to think about key variables and how they interact over time.
- you have to listen and chase down arguments that run counter to your views.
- you have to think about how you might be fooling yourself.
- you have to see the issue from multiple perspectives.
- you need to become your most intelligent critic and have the intellectual honesty to kill some of your best-loved ideas.
- doing the work counteracts our natural desire to seek out only information that confirms that we believe we know.

# Quotes
