# Main Takeaways
- “Small habits don’t add up. They compound.” – James Clear
- Habits are really about identity change. Behaviour change is simply the means to get there (feedback loop).
- The reward that closes the habit loop is often the satisfaction of the craving. We don’t desire external behaviour. We want the sensations that come with it.
- Stop trying to be a hero. (“Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behaviour.” – James Clear)
- The goal is not to fill your day with meaningless lifehacks. Focus on the big rocks and learn to embody your values/identity with small wins. “Standardize before you optimize” – James Clear
- “Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard.” – James Clear
- Focus on the decisive moments. Which habit/decision has a domino effect on the rest of your day?
- Track process metrics over outcome metrics. We can’t control the outcomes. Identify with showing up.
- Commitment devices are a powerful tool when combined with social accountability. Design your social environment.
- “Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work on.” – James Clear

# Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference

## The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

- Small deviations expand with time.
  - A plane off by 3.5 degrees when it takes flight results in hundreds of miles of error.
- “Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.” – James Clear
- Progress is like an ice cube sitting in a warming cold room.
  - The overnight success takes 10 years of build-up.
  - Cancer spends 80% of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months.
  - Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years (roots) before exploding 90 feet into the air within six weeks.
  - “Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored.” – James Clear
  - San Antonio Spurs locker room quote
    - stonecutter hammering 100 times with nothing. Yet at the 101 blow, it will split in two.
- The Plateau of Latent Potential & Valley of Disappointment
  - [Plateau of Latent Potential](./plateau-latent-potential.png)
- Systems > Goals
  - Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.
  - Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.
  - Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.
    - “Desire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.” – Naval Ravikant
  - Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.
    - “The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.” – James Clear
  - You do not need to choose between the two. Systems need a goal as a direction/compass.
  - “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” – James Clear

## How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
- The Onion of change
  - Try starting from the core and move outwards
    - Identity ==> Processes ==> Outcomes

- Identity = “repeated beingness” = (essentitas = being) + (identidem = repeatedly)
  - “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” – Aristotle
  - “The process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.” – James Clear

- The Identity-Habits Feedback Loop
  - “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.” – James Clear
  - Have a flexible identity.
    - Need to be able to drop and add parts of our identity to change our habits long term.
    - Bayesian Updating of our identity and beliefs

- The Two-Step Process to Changing your Identity
  - Decide the type of person you want to be.
    - Begin with the end in mind
    - “Identity change is the North Star of habit change.” – James Clear
    - “Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?” – James Clear

  - Prove it to yourself with small wins.
    - Tiny Habits – BJ Fogg

## How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

- We are like cats in a puzzle box (Edward Thorndike)
  - Our brain is a prediction machine that attempts to minimize surprise (Karl Friston)
  - Habits are programs/functions/solutions to reoccurring problems.
    - “The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.”
  - Correlation does not equal causation. Conditioning is correlational by definition.
    - We can pick up faulty habits without noticing them.

- “Discipline = Freedom” – Jocko Willink
  - Being on the fence is what hurts, not necessarily being on either side.
    - Decision fatigue
  - You can do and enjoy more things if your big pillars are taken care of.
    - The goal is not to fill your day with habits. It is to make room for the good stuff.

- Cue ==> Craving ==> Response ==> Reward
  - Problem Phase = (Cue + Craving)
  - Solution Phase = (Response + Reward)
  - The Buddhists saw craving (pulled towards) or aversion (pushed away) as the default reaction to any sensation.
    - The reward can simply be satisfying the craving.

# The 1st Law – Make It Obvious

## The Man Who Didn’t Look Right
- We can pick up habits subconsciously.
  - Our brain associates cues with conditioning.
  - Once the habit becomes automatic, it can become invisible.

- You need to be aware of your habits before you can consciously change them.
  - The process of behaviour change always starts with **awareness**.
  - [Pointing-and-Calling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_and_calling) raises awareness by verbalizing. It helps prevent train accidents caused by  habituation.
  - You can point-and-call when you are about to run a habit.
    - The written and spoken word bring abstract concepts into reality.

- The [Habit Scorecard](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/Atomic+Habits/The+Habits+Scorecard.pdf) (Tracking) is a simple tool to raise your awareness.
  - “There are no good habits or habits. There are only effective habits.” – James Clear
  - “Does this behaviour help me become the type of person I wish to be?”
  - “Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?”

- Simply observe.
  - The goal of tracking is not to change your behaviour. Track without judgement.
  - It is analogous to the non-judgement aspect of meditation. Try to observe yourself as a third person.

## The Best Way to Start a New Habit
- Implementation Intention
  - The two most common cues are time and location.
  - When situation X arises, I will perform Y.
  - “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”
  - Be specific. “I want to eat healthier.” ==> “I will [drink a green smoothie] at [my alarm at 7 am] in [the kitchen].

- If you aren’t sure when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month, or year.
- Habit Stacking
  - The Diderot Effect: The tendency for one purchase to lead to another.
  - “No behaviour happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behaviour.” – James Clear
  - “After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”
  - You can use a behaviour you already do each day as the cue for a new habit.
    - Wake up ==> Make my bed ==> Place a book on my pillow ==> Take a shower
    - Make sure your established cue occurs at the same frequency as the desired habit.
    - Brainstorm two lists for potential cues.
      - Habits you perform without fail (brush teeth, get out of bed, do dishes, …).
      - Things that happen to you without fail (you get a notification, you eat a meal, go to the washroom, …).
  - The cue needs to be immediately actionable.

## “Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behaviour.” – James Clear
- **Behaviour** is a function of the **Person** in their **Environment**. B = f(P, E)
  - [Fogg Behaviour Model](https://behaviormodel.org/): Behaviour = f(Motivation, Ability, Prompt): B = MAP
- The most powerful human sense is vision when it comes to cues/triggers/prompts.
  - “A small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do.” – James Clear
- Design your environment.
  - “If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make your cue a big part of your environment.” – James Clear
  - Design in more cues for desired habits. Eliminate cues for the habits you are trying to break.
    - Apples on the counter (obvious). Junk in the bottom of the closet (invisible).
    - Put the odds in your favour.

- Eventually, the context (time, location, people, … ) will become the cue.
  - “Our behaviour is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.” – James Clear
  - Couch = reading spot | couch = Netflix & Snacks, bed = sleep | bed = social media + emails
  - Habits can be easier to change in a new environment.
    - I quit Instagram on my first trip.
  - One space one use.
    - Reading chair, writing desk, eating table
    - Work laptop, reading Kindle, Netflix TV, social media tablet, phone for messages and calls.

## The Secret to Self-Control
- “Disciplined people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control.”
  - “The people with the best self-control are the people who need to use it the least.”
- Cue-induced wanting
  - Your brain can pick up on cues subconsciously and you’ll begin to crave something.
- “You can break a bad habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it.”
  - Strong neural pathways are like a bush road. After years of no usage, trees and weeds will start to grow back and slowly swallow the road. Despite that, it would still be easier to walk on the half-swallowed road than the forest.
- Environment >= Willpower
  - Short-term: Willpower can be used to avoid acute temptation.
  - Long-term: The environment we are in will have a bigger impact than our willpower does.
- “Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.”
  - Stop trying to be a hero and resist temptations. Eliminate and limit cues at their source.

# Quotes

Building better habits isn’t about littering your day with life hacks. It’s not about flossing one tooth each night or taking a cold shower each morning or wearing the same outfit each day. It’s not about achieving external measures of success like earning more money, losing weight, or reducing stress. Habits can help you achieve all of these things, but fundamentally they are not about having something. They are about becoming someone. - JAMES CLEAR
