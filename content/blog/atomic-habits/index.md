# Main Takeaways
- “Small habits don’t add up. They compound.” – James Clear
- Habits are really about identity change. Behaviour change is simply the means to get there (feedback loop).
- The reward that closes the habit loop is often the satisfaction of the craving. We don’t desire external behaviour. We want the sensations that come with it.
- Stop trying to be a hero. (“Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behaviour.” – James Clear)
- The goal is not to fill your day with meaningless lifehacks. Focus on the big rocks and learn to embody your values/identity with small wins. “Standardize before you optimize” – James Clear
- “Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard.” – James Clear
- Focus on the decisive moments. Which habit/decision has a domino effect on the rest of your day?
- Track process metrics over outcome metrics. We can’t control the outcomes. Identify with showing up.
- Commitment devices are a powerful tool when combined with social accountability. Design your social environment.
- “Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work on.” – James Clear

# Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference

## The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

- Small deviations expand with time.
  - A plane off by 3.5 degrees when it takes flight results in hundreds of miles of error.
- “Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.” – James Clear
- Progress is like an ice cube sitting in a warming cold room.
  - The overnight success takes 10 years of build-up.
  - Cancer spends 80% of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months.
  - Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years (roots) before exploding 90 feet into the air within six weeks.
  - “Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored.” – James Clear
  - San Antonio Spurs locker room quote
    - stonecutter hammering 100 times with nothing. Yet at the 101 blow, it will split in two.
- The Plateau of Latent Potential & Valley of Disappointment
  - [Plateau of Latent Potential](./plateau-latent-potential.png)
- Systems > Goals
  - Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.
  - Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.
  - Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.
    - “Desire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.” – Naval Ravikant
  - Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.
    - “The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.” – James Clear
  - You do not need to choose between the two. Systems need a goal as a direction/compass.
  - “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” – James Clear
