# take-aways

- When deciding whether to invest in a company, carefully analyze its soundness.
True investments keep the principal safe and deliver an acceptable return. Any purchase that doesn’t is speculation.
- Investors often profit by buying securities that are selling below their intrinsic value.
- The three main classes of security are "investment bonds and preferred stocks," "speculative bonds and preferred stocks," and "common stocks."
- An issuer’s financial strength and ability to pay determine its bonds’ safety.
- Preferred stocks should meet all the safety tests required of bonds.
- You can profit from the purchase of some bonds and preferred stocks that do not qualify as investment grade if they are selling below their intrinsic value.
- Privileged issues have the safety of preferred stocks, but they also have the upside potential of common stocks.
- Portfolio diversification can offset the variability of common stock prices.
- As an investor you should evaluate common stocks based on dividends, earnings and asset values.
- Each of the elements in valuation — assets, earnings power, and growth — is useful in its own right, but the best insights into a firm’s value come from comparisons among them, especially the direct comparison between the asset value and the EPV.
- If the EPV is substantially greater than the asset value, that difference is due to superior management or competitive advantages
- don’t make investments into things that have a NPV of less than zero


# Scope and Limits of Security Analysis
- Security analysis is the process of deciding which securities are sound investments. True investments keep the principal safe and deliver an acceptable return. Any purchase that does not meet these criteria is speculation.

- common obstacles to analyst
  - inadequate or incorrect data
  - uncertainties of future
  - irrational behavior of the market
  - "in the short term the market is a voting machine, but in the long term it tracks value"

- 3 functions of analysis
  - **Descriptive function** 
    - collecting important facts and presenting them in an understandable manner. This would reveal:
      - reveal strong and weak points
      - make comparisons with similar issues
      - appraise for future performance
  - **Selective Function**
    - express specific judgement, by determining whether an issue should be bought, held, sold, etc.
    - common approach is to analyze company's ability to earn and make payments to the investor.
    - Intrinsic value is the estimated valuation based on the analyst's opinion of the intrinsic worth of the security from different source of information such as assets, earnings, dividends, growth, management, etc...
      - value of a business can be analyzed from the perspective of multiple earnings (P/E ratio, "earnings power"). It is cautioned that valuing a business solely from the earnings power is very risky and uncharacteristic of wise analyst.
  - **Critical Function**
    - "Analytical judgments are reached by applying standards to facts"
    - should seek adequate protective provisions (margin of safety) in bonds and preferred stocks.
    - must be alert to the misrepresentation by accountants and management bad practices.

- Market analysis, in contrast to security analysis, attempts to forecast prices of individual securities or the action of the whole market, without referring to underlying facts about individual companies. One type of market analysis, called technical analysis, refers only to past market values in order to predict future values. A second type of analysis refers to indices of economic activity outside the market that, presumably, have some influence over security prices. Neither of these kinds of market analysis has proven effective and both essentially promote speculation over reasoned, fact-based investment.

- Intrinsic value is an important concept for security analysis. However, "intrinsic value is an elusive concept. In general terms, it is understood to be that value which is justified by the facts...the assets, earnings, dividends, definite prospects, as distinct...from market quotations established by artificial manipulation or distorted by psychological excess." Although investors cannot calculate an exact intrinsic value for a given security because so many variables are involved, careful examination can determine whether the price the market quotes is appropriate. Securities that meet stringent safety tests and appear to be selling well below their intrinsic value often can be profitable investments.

- Securities traditionally fall into two categories: stocks and bonds. This classification is inadequate, because it pays more attention to the form of the security than to its safety and purpose. The various types of securities may be more accurately classified into three groups, each of which has its own criteria for what constitutes a sound investment: fixed-value securities, including high-grade bonds and preferred stocks; variable-value senior securities, including speculative bonds and preferred stocks; and common stocks.

# Criteria for Investing in Fixed-Value Securities
- Bonds are not automatically safe investments because of their form. Rather, the soundness of a bond investment derives from the issuer’s ability to pay, which is, in turn, based on its financial strength. Therefore, the investor who is considering purchasing a bond should ask the following questions: Is the value of the company’s business more than the value of its debts? Can the company meet its financial obligations even in the worst-case scenario, such as a recession or depression?

- Although no company or industry is depression-proof, two factors contribute to a company’s resilience in hard times: dominant size within its industry and sufficient earnings to cover its bond interest by a large margin. Bonds of companies that do not meet these requirements are not considered investment grade, even if the yield is highly attractive. A high yield cannot compensate for failure to pay.

- Preferred stocks combine the limited return of bonds with the instability of common stocks. Despite these unattractive features, preferred stocks can be safe investments if they meet the same safety requirements as a bond, their margin of safety is large enough that management is unlikely to suspend preferred dividends, and the stability of the company exceeds that required for a bond investment. These stringent requirements limit the number of investment-grade preferred stocks to a very select group.

- Income bonds, also called adjustment bonds, should be subject to the same strict investment criteria as preferred stocks. Guaranteed issues occupy a position between bond debt and preferred stocks. Prospective investors must carefully examine the terms of the guarantee and evaluate the guarantor’s financial strength. Even with fixed-value investments, investors should periodically evaluate their holdings. There is no such thing as a permanent investment.

- Although many bonds and preferred stocks do not meet the requirements that would qualify them as investment grade, some issues in this category may nevertheless be worth purchasing, because they are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value. Investors must take care to avoid issues that are selling at a discount for other reasons – for example, because the company is financially unsound.

# Principles for selection of fixed-value investments

- avoid compromising the assumed risk for an increased reward to minimize the loss of principal
  - if risk is assumed, it should be in the form of paying a cheaper price (therefore lowering the principal required to acquire the security), instead of accepting a higher coupon or dividend.

## safety not measured by Lien but by ability to pay
- safety is measured by the ability of the issuer to meet obligations - not by contractual rights
- in theory, if a business fails, the bond holder recovers his money from assets; but that often fails because:
  - property values shrink when the business fails
  - there is difficulty in establishing legal rights
  - there are inherent delays in receivership
- to avoid trouble is better seeking protection after it occurs
- debt should bed assessed from the cashflow statement
  - "good" debt is when company is using financed capital for an opportunity or expansion that might require a quick entry to the market
  - "bad" debt is when the business is required to borrow in order to sustain operations.

## obligation possibility should be assessed in terms of depression, not prosperity
- bonds should be bought on their ability to withstand a depression or recession; relative safety is found in companies of a) dominant size, and b) substantial margin or earnings over bond interests.
- presumption of safety based upon either the character of the industry or the mount of protection
- investor should look for industries least likely to be affected by a depression.
- investment practice recognizes importance of character of the industry. **historically some industries and public utilities have been more stable than others, and equally their degree of stability has altered with time**. This changing dynamic must be considered when assessing an organization's ability to continue meeting future payments on fixed income securities
- depression performance as a test of merit.
- various causes of bond collapses
  - excessive funded debt of utilities: defaults were causes by over-extended debt, not by lack or earnings
  - stability of railroad earnings overrated: such as diminished earnings a failure to recognize changes in transportation methods
  - unavailability of sound bonds no excuse for buying poor ones. The investor should never be tempted by the lack of a good opportunity to venture into a poor one.
- there are 2 incorrect theories:
  - that issuing a bond is a statement of financial weakness
  - bonds are only issued when companies cannot issue stock
- proper theory of bond financing: A reasonable amount of funded debt is an advantage (typically rooted in the company's ability to take their product or service to market quickly). if the company need to issue debt to simply pay their bills and expenses, this is a signal that the bond is unsafe.
- significance of the foregoing to the investor: whenever there is money available to invest, it is invested. when higher yielding securities disappear from the market place, analysts need to accept a lower yielding security to ensure the protection of principal instead of choosing more yield in a second rate issue.

## Unsound to sacrifice safety for yield
- lack of safety is not compensated by a high dividend or coupon
- no mathematical relationship between yield and risk: prices and yields often depend on popularity. Graham suggests that the public's familiarity with the issuing company and its ability to be quickly sold on the market is a considerable factor in the market price of bonds
- the factor of cyclical risks: an insurance company spreads risk over a large field; the investor has only a small field and cannot afford a program entailing a small sample size with large risk
- risk and yield are incommensurable. Graham mentions, yet again, that the analyst should not pay a par value for a risky bond that has a high yield. Instead, he should pay a considerable discount below the par value, therefore minimizing his risk of principal. 
- reversal of customary procedure recommended: don't start with inspecting the safest fixed income issues on a list and work down. Instead, start with the security that represents a minimal threshold of safety and work up on the list. This way the analyst protects themselves from going deeper into the list - likely resulting in the purchase of an unsafe issue.

## definite standards of safety must be applied
- Graham recommends the implementation of similar rules and regulations that savings banks use for fixed income investments, since they are required and obligated by law to minimize their expose to risk.
- Graham recommends New York Savings Bank as the baseline, but the rules should be regarded loosely and amended if new metrics prove more useful and secure

# bond investments criteria

## nature and location of the business
- obligations of foreign governments
  - Graham agreed with the decision to disallow the purchase of foreign bonds for the following reasons:
    - the factor of political expediency
    - the foreign trade argument
    - the individual record argument: it is suggested some countries are more creditworthy than others. Graham argues that only Canada, Holland, and Switzerland demonstrated "unquestionable investing ratings" during his era
    - two-fold objection to purchase foreign government bonds. Generally speaking, foreign bonds should be avoided for 2 reasons
      - the basis for obtaining credit is fragile
      - the past performance is unsatisfactory. Graham then provides Canada as the sole exception to his doubts
- bonds of foreign corporations: in theory no company should do better than country in which it is located because the government could simply declare state ownership.
      

## size of the business
- small companies and small municipalities are vulnerable and their bonds should not be considered suitable for the conservative investor.
- NYSB critera example. Municipal bonds required a population of 10000 in adjacent states and 30000 elsewhere; railroads had to have 500 miles of track and annual operating revenues of 10 million nominal dollars, etc...
  - Graham agrees that the issuer should be of reasonable size, and he also suggests that the underlying theory of cash flow and ability to repay the holder of the security is more meaningful
- industrial bonds and factor of size: Graham feels these bonds are safe if tested against strick standards. He recommends limiting selections to the six largest corporations in any particular industry.
- large size alone no guarantee of safety, the size should not be applied to municipalities and utilities, but only to industries.

## terms of issue
- NYSB only accept public utility bonds only when secured by mortgages. An exception is made for unsecured railroad and income bonds if earnings and dividend records meet severe stipulated rules. Graham argues that the company's ability to meet its obligations is the top consideration.
- income bonds in weaker position than debentures. Debentures are required to make payments; where as income bonds are not required to make payments. As a result, Graham believes the mandatory coupon payment for a debenture provides less risk to the holder than an income bond.
- standards of safety should not be relaxed because of early maturity. If 2 different bonds, a short term and a long term, are issued and secured by the same company. The risk is no different for either bond if the short-term issue can't be paid at maturity.

## record of solvency and dividend payment
- the investor should ensure the issuer of the bond has a long record of financial stability and should avoid those which do not have a history of success. NYSBs requires 10 years history of payments on issues from other states and 25 year history from municipalities.
- investor should not take higher return for risk, instead they should pay a lower principal. For examples, when a municipal government issues new bonds at higher interest rates, because of the risk of default, the investor should be skeptical of such investments
- strict quantitative tests would focus on population size, the revenues received and current liabilities
- dividend record not conclusive evidence of financial strenth
- balance sheet and income statement provide better clues about a company's ability to meet future coupon payments than historical dividend performance. 
- if dividend is withheld or reduced to the common shareholders, the health of bond may be in jeopardy

## relation of earnings to interest requirements

- safety of a bond can be evaluated by comparing the company's earnings to its interest obligations
- total deduction or "Over-all" Method
  - Graham suggests that all bonds are dependent on each other, he expects all issues to fail if the payment of one cannot be completed.
  - coverage ratio = earnings / total interests on all issues
- minimum requirements for earnings coverage. It's different for each industries.
- period comprised by the earnings test. NYSB assesses the 5 previous years for determining the safety of an issue. Graham suggests that the most recent years are the most important
- the relation of the coupon rate to earnings coverage
  - effect of coupon rate on safety: good companies fetch lower interest rates compared to risky companies. This means that good credit produces better credit
  - effect of rise interest rates on safety
    - if the investors considers a rise in interest rates probable, he should not buy long-term low coupon bonds, no matter how strong the company. inversely, if an investor considers a drop in interest rates, he should buy long-term bonds that meet significant levels of safety.

## relation of value of the property to funded debt
- the soundness of the bond rests on the ability of the issuing corporation to support its financial obligations, and much less on the potential value of its property for a lien. With that in mind, there is no purpose in devising a minimal pledged level of property value to support the bond.
- **special types of obligations**
  - **equipment obligations**:
    - equipment trust certificates may be issued against specific items of use by the corporation, for instance, again, a car. Although these certificates promise safety at time of sale, the debtor may only receive 50% of what he expects.
  - **collateral-trust bonds**
    - these are bonds that are secured by common stock or other bonds, often of the same corporation.
    - these bonds offer very little security if issued from the same corporation or subsidiary.
  - **real estate bonds**
    - the value of the property is often directly related to the success of the corporation.
    - property values and earning power closely related. Graham forcefully cautions investor that this is not true for buildings that were erected for special purposes and manufacturing
    - misleading character of appraisals
    - abnormal rental used as basis of valuation
    - debt based on excessive construction costs: over-valuation led to over-building which raised construction costs. When the market caught up, the loan against the expensive costs could not be supported.
    - weakness of specialized buildings such as hospital or factory
    - values based on initial rentals misleading: rentals obtained on a new building are higher that can be obtained for an old building. The duration of the bond issue needs to account for a declining premium for rent due to the age of the building
    - suggested rules of procedure
      - for single family dwellings, the lender should be sure the amount lent is not more than two thirds the value of the property as determined by the market assessment.
      - the lender should fully understand the costs associated with constructing the property and not exceed the mortgage by 50%
      - there should be conservatively structured income account that accounts for vacancies and a building that doesn't fetch the premium of a newly constructed property. This account should demonstrate quality coverage over the net income.

## relation of stock capitalization to funded debt

## special factors in bond analysis


# Criteria for Purchasing Speculative Senior Securities
- Some senior securities carry certain privileges that make them attractive purchases on a speculative basis, including:
  - "Convertible issues" – In certain cases, investors can exchange convertible issues for common stock.
  - "Participating issues" – Investors can receive part of any increased dividend that common stockholders earn.
  - "Subscription-warrant issues" – These include option warrants to purchase common stock.

- These issues combine the increased safety of a senior security and the possible price appreciation of common stock. However, as with bonds, the attractive form does not mean that all securities of this type are safe. Only a limited number of such issues meet investment-grade safety requirements; the remainder belong to the same category as common-stock investments, because they share that category’s speculative features. When evaluating privileged issues, consider the amount of the profit-sharing benefits per dollar invested, the proximity of the event that will trigger profit-sharing advantages and the duration of the privileges.

# Criteria for Investing in Common Stocks
- Common stocks, as a class, are much more speculative than senior issues. Yet they are important to the US financial system, and novice and expert investors alike eagerly follow their prices, so security analysts know how to deal with them. The false belief that common stocks were a good buy at any price – as long as the company’s earning trend was positive – partly fueled the crash of 1929. Clearly the practice of making common-stock investments safer deserves further analysis, because the possibility of significant price appreciation will always lure investors to this type of security.

- Although the instability of common stock prices makes any given organization a dubious investment, portfolio diversification can offset this risk to some extent. Investors should subject their common stocks portfolios to thorough analysis.

- Uncertainty regarding future growth is usually the main reason why value estimations based on present value calculations are so prone to error

## theory of common stock investment
- investment in common stock is often speculative and analysis may be inconclusive and unsatisfactory.
  - common stock are of basic importance and of enormous interest
  - the owners of the common stock with to know their value
  - human nature often masks logic behind an endless cycle of greed for profit.
- **history of common stock analysis**: over the previous 30 years (from 1910-1940), common stocks have become more favored due to their substantial earnings and dividends. With more and more companies providing detailed financial information, investors have had statistical data to substantiate their investments. During 1927-1929, Graham says most investors neglected this analysis and simply purchased more common stock based on speculative greed for profit and prophecy
- **analysis vitiated by 2 types of instability**: 
  - Graham suggests 2 types of instability will destroy the analysis of common stock:
    - instability of tangibles aspect
    - an enormous importance placed on intangible aspects
- a company's market price was generally stable and predictable if the companies had the following characteristics:
  - the company paid a reasonable and consistent dividend
  - earnings were stable and averaged a substantial margin over dividend
  - each dollar of market price was backed by actual assets of equal value on the balance sheet - Or in other words, the book value was similar to the market price
- **prewar (WW1) conception of investment in common stocks**
  - prior to the world war, the analyst was primarily concerned with finding common stocks that paid consistent dividends and possessed stable earnings. In general, most emphasis was placed on past performance and little on future earnings growth.
  - speculation characterized by emphasis on future prospects
  - technique of investing in common stocks resembled that for bonds
  - buying common stocks viewed as taking a share in a business
    - if a businessman were going to purchase an entire company outright, he would likely start with the net worth of all the assets (or equity on the balance sheet), and then consider if the choice produced adequate earnings for the price. After looking at the earnings that the company produced, the investor would decide if he was willing to pay a premium or discount to that par value (or book value)

## newer cannons of common stock investment

- **the new era theory**
  - during the roaring 1920's, there's idea that value of common stocks was completely dependent on what it will earn in the future. This new thesis had three supporting insights:
    - the dividend holds little emphasis on the value
    - the relationship between asset value and earnings power had little significance
    - the past earnings were of little significant value except when signifying momentum in growth
  - **cases for this changed viewpoint**
    - in short, Graham thinks that the drastic change in common stock valuation stemmed from unpredictable results often seen from using historical data and the irresistible potential for profits that had occurred.
    - in the early 1930's many liquidations occurred. These events often produced very little value for the fixed assets the companies had listed on their balance sheets. This experience also caused investors to abandon the emphasis on book value or net-work of assets.
  - **attention shifted to the trend of earnings**
  - **the common stocks as long term investments doctrine**
    - few key points
      - the value was based on what the common stock could earn in the future
      - good common stocks have a rising earnings (or EPS)
        - what it excludes is the idea that a price is associated with the earnings one can expect to receive
      - relies on an improvement in the stock's future performance.
      - therefore making the approach **speculative**.
  - **new era investment equivalent to prewar speculation**
  - **stocks regarded as attractive irrespective of their prices**: non-sense
  - investment trusts came to resemble this new doctrine
    - analysis abandoned by investment trusts. Graham voices his disgust for the professional investor who didn't safe guard the capital of their customers due to a lazy assessment of facts and risk analysis
  - **a sound premise used to support an unsound conclusion**
    - in 1924, a book by the name of common stocks as long-term investments, by edgar lawrence smith was published. the premise of the book is that common stocks outperform bonds because not all the earnings are paid to the owners as dividends. This retained earnings by the company makes the value of the common stock increase in market price. Although Graham agreed with the basic tenants of Edgar's thesis, he strongly disagrees with the exaggeration many investors took in their application of his ideas.
  - **average vs trend of earnings**
    - Graham suggests that earnings trends and earning averages are nothing more than speculative tools for analysts to predict future results. In fact, companies that have accelerated growth demonstrate an untapped market for more competitors.

## three general approaches

- **secular expansion as basis**
  - have a diversified portfolio of common stocks
  - when recessions occur, the investor can still benefit in the common stock markets by 1) diversifying their portfolio, and 2) by adamantly rejecting common stocks trade for excessive premiums.
  - Graham says the investor cannot rely on historical earnings growth to provide safety and profit in the long haul. Specifically, he's talking about companies that are commonly referred to as "growth picks"

- **individual growth as basis of sections**
  - use quantitative and qualitative factor to determine the value of common stocks similarly to the techniques for bonds.
  - what are growth companies?
    - maybe a company whose earnings move forward from cycle to cycle.
    - maybe company's earnings grow at a faster rate than the general market
  - can investor identify them?
    - no, typical investor can't realistically determine when and where the company's growth will eventually subside. As a result, there's a strong chance that the investor might select the stock "at the top of the earnings wave"
  - does the price discount the potential growth?
    - it's difficult to determine the price to pay for the future earnings that haven't been demonstrated yet.
    - it's impossible to predict how much longer the earnings growth is going to take place. One thing almost everyone can agree is that high earnings growth (like 30%) is temporary and not sustainable.
  - may such purchases be described as investment commitments
    - can thorough analysis and thought go into the selection of the growth stock.
      - maybe yes, as some growth investors do conduct themselves appropriately
    - is the price paid for the investment something that a reasonable person would pay if they could buy the whole business?
      - if a person is willing to pay more than 20% more for a common stock than he would for outright ownership of the entire business, the pick become speculative.
  - utilize even more effort than bonds to assess the future outlook of common stocks

- **selection based on margin of safety principle**
  - factors complicating efforts to exploit general market swings
    - index of leading stocks were selected and analyzed as a group (like the S&P 500). Also a base or normal value for the group of stocks could be determined by taking their average earnings and capitalizing them at the going long term interest rate (like the 10 or 30 year federal bond). This is where Graham tell analysts that the intrinsic value of stocks is directly tied to interest rates.
      - this approach has 3 drawbacks
        - first, the general market patterns may be anticipated, but the actual buying and selling points may still be chosen poorly.
        - market behavior may change in the future and not response in the same manner as before
        - this approach requires a very determined and vigilant individual because his actions will be the opposite of human psychology.
  - the undervalued individual issue approach:
    - likelihood of finding an individual common stock that possess the qualitative factors and the quantitative factors (compared to price) is rare. if this type of stock issue is found, Graham says it should be classified as an investment and not speculation.
    - Graham says the most important way to view the purchase of a common stock is if the investor could purchase the entire business at once.

## 1. Dividends
- Before investing in a common stock, investigate both the firm’s dividend rate and its history of paying dividends. The dividend rate is important, because a dollar of surplus earnings is worth more to the investor when the company chooses to pay it as a dividend instead of reinvesting it in the business. Generally, companies that pay higher dividends have higher stock prices. However, management can suspend common-stock dividends at any time, so it is important to view the company’s dividend history as an indication, but not a guarantee, of future income.

- **Extraordinary stock dividends** (stock splits), on the other hand, are largely illusory, because they give investors nothing they did not already own. An improvement on this practice is for companies to pay periodic stock dividends, representing a return to the shareholders of surplus earnings reinvested in the business.
  - although stock dividends and stock splits create no real value for the holders, much speculation about the value of the companies after the division is likely to occur due to the cheaper price.

- **periodic stock dividends**
  - with a periodic stock dividend, the shareholder often receives a smller and reasonable stock dividend that adds value over time.
  - company should not provide a periodic stock dividend if the amount exceeds the funds being retained in earnings. The dividend could eventually exceeded the company's ability to retain earnings power and the EPS slowly declined over a 10 year period, along with the market price.
  - Graham suggests the dividend should be dispersed as a preferred share.
    - it doesn't weaken the capital structure of the business like the common stock dividend.
    - allows the company to retain earnings until a safe and manageable surplus is realized.
    - this technique gives management flexibility and control to pay the dividend as long as they choose.
    - once the retained earnings have been distributed, the obligation is no longer on the books once the preferred share is repurchased by the company.

- Graham suggests that the market price of common stocks will perform similarly if management pays a healthy and sustainable dividend.
- **established principle of withholding dividends**
  - Graham claims that 2 companies with the same general business model and the same earnings will trade at different prices if the dividend policy is different. The market will value the company with the higher dividend more favorably.
  - should a company pay a lower dividend in order to create stability for the owner with an assured payment, or should they pay a higher dividend and meet its obligation irregularly.

- **the merits of "plowing back" earnings**
  - there're 2 reasons retained earnings is beneficial to the stock holder.
    - whatever good for the company was good for the shareholder.
    - company that retained earnings had more agility to remain competitive in difficult markets.
  - if a company sustains a favorable ROE over a long period of time, it means the management is properly investing the retained earnings and adding value to the shareholder.
- **dividend policies arbitrary and sometimes selfishly determined**
  - Graham suggests that many board members are executives and friends of executives with very large portion of shares. As a result, they might want to minimize their personal tax burden by receiving smaller dividends from the company.
  - leadership may seek a larger and more impressive sized business, therefore, using retained earnings to full fill their pursuit of an ever growing business (which may or may not add more earnings)
  - management may seek the opportunity to purchase outstanding shares at lower prices with the retained earnings.
  - a management that pays a small dividend is able to pay excessive salaries to executives and top level employees.
- **arbitrary control of dividend policy complicates analysis of common stocks**
- **suggested principle for dividend payments**: Graham holds the strong opinion that a company should pay a large portion of their earnings to the shareholders. He says it's more important for the shareholder to receive non-standard (or inconsistent) dividend rates at a higher return, instead of a lower and more consistent dividend, which likely results in the company accumulating reserves that add little value.
## 2. Earnings

- To analyze earnings, carefully study the company’s income statement. While earnings are undoubtedly important, security analysts have accorded them too much weight in calculating a company’s investment soundness. Management can manipulate a company’s earnings many ways. Therefore, always examine the firm’s income statement with a critical eye. For example, businesses can engineer nonrecurring charges and profits to produce a favorable earnings trend. A firm’s accountants also can generate perceived earnings by lowering or increasing the company’s reserves, or by reporting subsidiaries’ results in different ways. Companies can also present depreciation and amortization costs in a misleading manner.

- Investors must pay attention to more than current earnings. They should consider both the earnings trend and the long-term earnings average – preferably seven to ten years, putting more weight on the latter number. The analyst’s job is not predicting the future of a trend or intuiting possible price changes; it is making decisions based on facts.

## 3. Asset Value
- To gauge asset value, inspect the business’s balance sheet. A firm’s book value per share equals the total value of its tangible assets divided by the number of shares outstanding. Wall Street has almost entirely superseded the importance of asset value with earnings. Although rules of thumb for the proper ratio of market price to book value vary, you still should investigate the underlying value of a business’s assets before investing.

- The current-asset value – that is, current assets minus liabilities – is perhaps a more important number. It excludes both intangible assets and fixed assets and is, therefore, a rough approximation of the value of the company should it go in to liquidation. As a general rule, if a firm’s market price is below its liquidation value, the company has either been undervalued or it should be liquidated. Investors who can distinguish between the undervalued issues and the ones performing poorly due to fundamental unsoundness can realize a significant upside.

- In addition, examine the balance sheet to make sure that the company has an adequate cash position, that its current assets (exclusive of inventories) at least equal its current liabilities, and that it does not have a large amount of debt maturing soon, which could create refinancing problems.

- there should be no discount from the amount stated on the company's books for cash and marketable securities, provided the securities are short term or marked to the market. The same holds true for property, plant, and equipment
- economic value of the assets is the reproduction costs of a new firm starting out in the same industry.
  - we first find the current market prices for the securities. Then we must adjust the book value of the firm's accounts receivable and inventory up or down to get a more realistic reproduction costs

- it is important to note that goodwill represents a prior blunder that must be ignored when calculating the intrinsic value of a company.

- liabilities and equity are the sources of funds that support the assets, which are the uses to which those funds are put
- there are 3 types of liabilities
  - those that arise from the normal conduct of the business
  - those that arise from past circumstances that are not pertinent to a new entrant
  - the outstanding formal debt of the company.
- when we start with the reproduction cost of the assets and then subtract the first 2 categories of liabilities, we are left with the asset value of the whole enterprise.
- The defining character of a franchise is that it enables a firm to earn more than it needs to pay for the investments that fund its assets. The intrinsic value of a firm is either the reproduction costs of the assets, which should equal the EPV or those assets plus the competitive advantages of the firm that underlie its franchise. The initial judgment that has to be made is whether the firm currently has a competitive advantage, and, if so, how strong and sustainable it is

# The Relationship Between Owners and Managers
- The interests of shareholders and those of management do not always coincide. Most shareholders defer to the wisdom of management without demanding their rights as owners of the business. In the case of companies whose common stocks sell for less than the liquidating value, the shareholders may be best served by the liquidation of the company, but that would put management out of a job, so shareholders cannot depend on management to make the right decision. Investors need to educate themselves about management practices and take these lessons into account when making investments.

- Remember, however, that "analysis connotes the careful study of available facts with the attempt to draw conclusions therefrom based on established principles and sound logic. It is part of the scientific method. But in applying analysis to the field of securities, [you will] encounter the serious obstacle that investment is by nature not an exact science." Still, professional analysis is "not only useful, but indispensable."

# Themes of value investing

## Focusing on the differences between investing and speculating
  - failure to distinguish one from another has led to tragedies.
  - investments are bonds, outright purchases, permanent holding, for income, in safe securities.
  - speculations are stocks, purchases on margin, for a "quick turn", for profit, in risky issues.
  - specific standards have to be applied to give meaning to the term "safety"
  - an investment operation promises the safety of the principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.
  - an investment operation is one that can be justified on both qualitative and quantitative grounds.
  - investment is founded on the past and present, speculation relies on the future to improve.
  - for the investor, the future is to be guarded against rather than profit from.
  - for the speculator, he anticipates the future will be better than the past.
  - "intelligent speculation" is taking a measured risk that seems justified after analysis
  - "unintelligent speculation" is taking a risk without adequate examination of the situation
  - safety is measured in terms of the ability of the issuer to meet obligations
    - that ability should be assessed in terms of depression, not prosperity
  - lack of safety is not compensated by high dividends
  - Avoiding trouble is better than seeking protection after it occurs.
  - a sound investment must be able to withstand adversity. Enterprises that have withstood adversity may be favored by investors.
  - investment for profit, where growth is generally expected, the price is rarely reasonable.
  - the investor of small means may opt to step out of his role and become a speculator. He may also opt to regret his actions.
## Analysis skills
  - The term analysis indicates a scientific and methodical study of facts, which results in logical conclusions. But investment is not an exact science, and success derives in part from personal skills and chance.
  - analytical judgments are reached by applying standards to facts
  - analyst must preserve a sense of proportion, analyze what matters and ignore what trivial
truth seeker
- there are 3 types of variables used to rank stocks: fundamental, growth, and profitability.
- the most common variables used to select stocks are those that relate the price of the shares to some fundamental company information: share price to earnings, share price to cash flow, share price to book value, share price to sales, or share price to dividends.
