# take-aways

- When deciding whether to invest in a company, carefully analyze its soundness.
True investments keep the principal safe and deliver an acceptable return. Any purchase that doesn’t is speculation.
- Investors often profit by buying securities that are selling below their intrinsic value.
- The three main classes of security are "investment bonds and preferred stocks," "speculative bonds and preferred stocks," and "common stocks."
- An issuer’s financial strength and ability to pay determine its bonds’ safety.
- Preferred stocks should meet all the safety tests required of bonds.
- You can profit from the purchase of some bonds and preferred stocks that do not qualify as investment grade if they are selling below their intrinsic value.
- Privileged issues have the safety of preferred stocks, but they also have the upside potential of common stocks.
- Portfolio diversification can offset the variability of common stock prices.
- As an investor you should evaluate common stocks based on dividends, earnings and asset values.
- Each of the elements in valuation — assets, earnings power, and growth — is useful in its own right, but the best insights into a firm’s value come from comparisons among them, especially the direct comparison between the asset value and the EPV.
- If the EPV is substantially greater than the asset value, that difference is due to superior management or competitive advantages
- don’t make investments into things that have a NPV of less than zero


# Scope and Limits of Security Analysis
- Security analysis is the process of deciding which securities are sound investments. True investments keep the principal safe and deliver an acceptable return. Any purchase that does not meet these criteria is speculation.

- common obstacles to analyst
  - inadequate or incorrect data
  - uncertainties of future
  - irrational behavior of the market
  - "in the short term the market is a voting machine, but in the long term it tracks value"

- 3 functions of analysis
  - **Descriptive function** 
    - collecting important facts and presenting them in an understandable manner. This would reveal:
      - reveal strong and weak points
      - make comparisons with similar issues
      - appraise for future performance
  - **Selective Function**
    - express specific judgement, by determining whether an issue should be bought, held, sold, etc.
    - common approach is to analyze company's ability to earn and make payments to the investor.
    - Intrinsic value is the estimated valuation based on the analyst's opinion of the intrinsic worth of the security from different source of information such as assets, earnings, dividends, growth, management, etc...
      - value of a business can be analyzed from the perspective of multiple earnings (P/E ratio, "earnings power"). It is cautioned that valuing a business solely from the earnings power is very risky and uncharacteristic of wise analyst.
  - **Critical Function**
    - "Analytical judgments are reached by applying standards to facts"
    - should seek adequate protective provisions (margin of safety) in bonds and preferred stocks.
    - must be alert to the misrepresentation by accountants and management bad practices.

- Market analysis, in contrast to security analysis, attempts to forecast prices of individual securities or the action of the whole market, without referring to underlying facts about individual companies. One type of market analysis, called technical analysis, refers only to past market values in order to predict future values. A second type of analysis refers to indices of economic activity outside the market that, presumably, have some influence over security prices. Neither of these kinds of market analysis has proven effective and both essentially promote speculation over reasoned, fact-based investment.

- Intrinsic value is an important concept for security analysis. However, "intrinsic value is an elusive concept. In general terms, it is understood to be that value which is justified by the facts...the assets, earnings, dividends, definite prospects, as distinct...from market quotations established by artificial manipulation or distorted by psychological excess." Although investors cannot calculate an exact intrinsic value for a given security because so many variables are involved, careful examination can determine whether the price the market quotes is appropriate. Securities that meet stringent safety tests and appear to be selling well below their intrinsic value often can be profitable investments.

- Securities traditionally fall into two categories: stocks and bonds. This classification is inadequate, because it pays more attention to the form of the security than to its safety and purpose. The various types of securities may be more accurately classified into three groups, each of which has its own criteria for what constitutes a sound investment: fixed-value securities, including high-grade bonds and preferred stocks; variable-value senior securities, including speculative bonds and preferred stocks; and common stocks.

# Criteria for Investing in Fixed-Value Securities
- Bonds are not automatically safe investments because of their form. Rather, the soundness of a bond investment derives from the issuer’s ability to pay, which is, in turn, based on its financial strength. Therefore, the investor who is considering purchasing a bond should ask the following questions: Is the value of the company’s business more than the value of its debts? Can the company meet its financial obligations even in the worst-case scenario, such as a recession or depression?

- Although no company or industry is depression-proof, two factors contribute to a company’s resilience in hard times: dominant size within its industry and sufficient earnings to cover its bond interest by a large margin. Bonds of companies that do not meet these requirements are not considered investment grade, even if the yield is highly attractive. A high yield cannot compensate for failure to pay.

- Preferred stocks combine the limited return of bonds with the instability of common stocks. Despite these unattractive features, preferred stocks can be safe investments if they meet the same safety requirements as a bond, their margin of safety is large enough that management is unlikely to suspend preferred dividends, and the stability of the company exceeds that required for a bond investment. These stringent requirements limit the number of investment-grade preferred stocks to a very select group.

- Income bonds, also called adjustment bonds, should be subject to the same strict investment criteria as preferred stocks. Guaranteed issues occupy a position between bond debt and preferred stocks. Prospective investors must carefully examine the terms of the guarantee and evaluate the guarantor’s financial strength. Even with fixed-value investments, investors should periodically evaluate their holdings. There is no such thing as a permanent investment.

- Although many bonds and preferred stocks do not meet the requirements that would qualify them as investment grade, some issues in this category may nevertheless be worth purchasing, because they are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value. Investors must take care to avoid issues that are selling at a discount for other reasons – for example, because the company is financially unsound.

# Principles for selection of fixed-value investments

- avoid compromising the assumed risk for an increased reward to minimize the loss of principal
  - if risk is assumed, it should be in the form of paying a cheaper price (therefore lowering the principal required to acquire the security), instead of accepting a higher coupon or dividend.

## safety not measured by Lien but by ability to pay
- safety is measured by the ability of the issuer to meet obligations - not by contractual rights
- in theory, if a business fails, the bond holder recovers his money from assets; but that often fails because:
  - property values shrink when the business fails
  - there is difficulty in establishing legal rights
  - there are inherent delays in receivership
- to avoid trouble is better seeking protection after it occurs
- debt should bed assessed from the cashflow statement
  - "good" debt is when company is using financed capital for an opportunity or expansion that might require a quick entry to the market
  - "bad" debt is when the business is required to borrow in order to sustain operations.

## obligation possibility should be assessed in terms of depression, not prosperity
- bonds should be bought on their ability to withstand a depression or recession; relative safety is found in companies of a) dominant size, and b) substantial margin or earnings over bond interests.
- presumption of safety based upon either the character of the industry or the mount of protection
- investor should look for industries least likely to be affected by a depression.
- investment practice recognizes importance of character of the industry. **historically some industries and public utilities have been more stable than others, and equally their degree of stability has altered with time**. This changing dynamic must be considered when assessing an organization's ability to continue meeting future payments on fixed income securities
- depression performance as a test of merit.
- various causes of bond collapses
  - excessive funded debt of utilities: defaults were causes by over-extended debt, not by lack or earnings
  - stability of railroad earnings overrated: such as diminished earnings a failure to recognize changes in transportation methods
  - unavailability of sound bonds no excuse for buying poor ones. The investor should never be tempted by the lack of a good opportunity to venture into a poor one.
- there are 2 incorrect theories:
  - that issuing a bond is a statement of financial weakness
  - bonds are only issued when companies cannot issue stock
- proper theory of bond financing: A reasonable amount of funded debt is an advantage (typically rooted in the company's ability to take their product or service to market quickly). if the company need to issue debt to simply pay their bills and expenses, this is a signal that the bond is unsafe.
- significance of the foregoing to the investor: whenever there is money available to invest, it is invested. when higher yielding securities disappear from the market place, analysts need to accept a lower yielding security to ensure the protection of principal instead of choosing more yield in a second rate issue.

## Unsound to sacrifice safety for yield
- lack of safety is not compensated by a high dividend or coupon
- no mathematical relationship between yield and risk: prices and yields often depend on popularity. Graham suggests that the public's familiarity with the issuing company and its ability to be quickly sold on the market is a considerable factor in the market price of bonds
- the factor of cyclical risks: an insurance company spreads risk over a large field; the investor has only a small field and cannot afford a program entailing a small sample size with large risk
- risk and yield are incommensurable. Graham mentions, yet again, that the analyst should not pay a par value for a risky bond that has a high yield. Instead, he should pay a considerable discount below the par value, therefore minimizing his risk of principal. 
- reversal of customary procedure recommended: don't start with inspecting the safest fixed income issues on a list and work down. Instead, start with the security that represents a minimal threshold of safety and work up on the list. This way the analyst protects themselves from going deeper into the list - likely resulting in the purchase of an unsafe issue.

## definite standards of safety must be applied
- Graham recommends the implementation of similar rules and regulations that savings banks use for fixed income investments, since they are required and obligated by law to minimize their expose to risk.
- Graham recommends New York Savings Bank as the baseline, but the rules should be regarded loosely and amended if new metrics prove more useful and secure

# bond investments criteria

## nature and location of the business
- obligations of foreign governments
  - Graham agreed with the decision to disallow the purchase of foreign bonds for the following reasons:
    - the factor of political expediency
    - the foreign trade argument
    - the individual record argument: it is suggested some countries are more creditworthy than others. Graham argues that only Canada, Holland, and Switzerland demonstrated "unquestionable investing ratings" during his era
    - two-fold objection to purchase foreign government bonds. Generally speaking, foreign bonds should be avoided for 2 reasons
      - the basis for obtaining credit is fragile
      - the past performance is unsatisfactory. Graham then provides Canada as the sole exception to his doubts
- bonds of foreign corporations: in theory no company should do better than country in which it is located because the government could simply declare state ownership.
      

## size of the business
- small companies and small municipalities are vulnerable and their bonds should not be considered suitable for the conservative investor.
- NYSB critera example. Municipal bonds required a population of 10000 in adjacent states and 30000 elsewhere; railroads had to have 500 miles of track and annual operating revenues of 10 million nominal dollars, etc...
  - Graham agrees that the issuer should be of reasonable size, and he also suggests that the underlying theory of cash flow and ability to repay the holder of the security is more meaningful
- industrial bonds and factor of size: Graham feels these bonds are safe if tested against strick standards. He recommends limiting selections to the six largest corporations in any particular industry.
- large size alone no guarantee of safety, the size should not be applied to municipalities and utilities, but only to industries.

## terms of issue
- NYSB only accept public utility bonds only when secured by mortgages. An exception is made for unsecured railroad and income bonds if earnings and dividend records meet severe stipulated rules. Graham argues that the company's ability to meet its obligations is the top consideration.
- income bonds in weaker position than debentures. Debentures are required to make payments; where as income bonds are not required to make payments. As a result, Graham believes the mandatory coupon payment for a debenture provides less risk to the holder than an income bond.
- standards of safety should not be relaxed because of early maturity. If 2 different bonds, a short term and a long term, are issued and secured by the same company. The risk is no different for either bond if the short-term issue can't be paid at maturity.

## record of solvency and dividend payment
- the investor should ensure the issuer of the bond has a long record of financial stability and should avoid those which do not have a history of success. NYSBs requires 10 years history of payments on issues from other states and 25 year history from municipalities.
- investor should not take higher return for risk, instead they should pay a lower principal. For examples, when a municipal government issues new bonds at higher interest rates, because of the risk of default, the investor should be skeptical of such investments
- strict quantitative tests would focus on population size, the revenues received and current liabilities
- dividend record not conclusive evidence of financial strenth
- balance sheet and income statement provide better clues about a company's ability to meet future coupon payments than historical dividend performance. 
- if dividend is withheld or reduced to the common shareholders, the health of bond may be in jeopardy

## relation of earnings to interest requirements

- safety of a bond can be evaluated by comparing the company's earnings to its interest obligations
- total deduction or "Over-all" Method
  - Graham suggests that all bonds are dependent on each other, he expects all issues to fail if the payment of one cannot be completed.
  - coverage ratio = earnings / total interests on all issues
- minimum requirements for earnings coverage. It's different for each industries.
- period comprised by the earnings test. NYSB assesses the 5 previous years for determining the safety of an issue. Graham suggests that the most recent years are the most important
- the relation of the coupon rate to earnings coverage
  - effect of coupon rate on safety: good companies fetch lower interest rates compared to risky companies. This means that good credit produces better credit
  - effect of rise interest rates on safety
    - if the investors considers a rise in interest rates probable, he should not buy long-term low coupon bonds, no matter how strong the company. inversely, if an investor considers a drop in interest rates, he should buy long-term bonds that meet significant levels of safety.

# Criteria for Purchasing Speculative Senior Securities
- Some senior securities carry certain privileges that make them attractive purchases on a speculative basis, including:
  - "Convertible issues" – In certain cases, investors can exchange convertible issues for common stock.
  - "Participating issues" – Investors can receive part of any increased dividend that common stockholders earn.
  - "Subscription-warrant issues" – These include option warrants to purchase common stock.

- These issues combine the increased safety of a senior security and the possible price appreciation of common stock. However, as with bonds, the attractive form does not mean that all securities of this type are safe. Only a limited number of such issues meet investment-grade safety requirements; the remainder belong to the same category as common-stock investments, because they share that category’s speculative features. When evaluating privileged issues, consider the amount of the profit-sharing benefits per dollar invested, the proximity of the event that will trigger profit-sharing advantages and the duration of the privileges.

# Criteria for Investing in Common Stocks
- Common stocks, as a class, are much more speculative than senior issues. Yet they are important to the US financial system, and novice and expert investors alike eagerly follow their prices, so security analysts know how to deal with them. The false belief that common stocks were a good buy at any price – as long as the company’s earning trend was positive – partly fueled the crash of 1929. Clearly the practice of making common-stock investments safer deserves further analysis, because the possibility of significant price appreciation will always lure investors to this type of security.

- Although the instability of common stock prices makes any given organization a dubious investment, portfolio diversification can offset this risk to some extent. Investors should subject their common stocks portfolios to thorough analysis.

- Uncertainty regarding future growth is usually the main reason why value estimations based on present value calculations are so prone to error

- Examine the following three crucial factors:

## 1. Dividends
- Before investing in a common stock, investigate both the firm’s dividend rate and its history of paying dividends. The dividend rate is important, because a dollar of surplus earnings is worth more to the investor when the company chooses to pay it as a dividend instead of reinvesting it in the business. Generally, companies that pay higher dividends have higher stock prices. However, management can suspend common-stock dividends at any time, so it is important to view the company’s dividend history as an indication, but not a guarantee, of future income.

- Extraordinary stock dividends (stock splits), on the other hand, are largely illusory, because they give investors nothing they did not already own. An improvement on this practice is for companies to pay periodic stock dividends, representing a return to the shareholders of surplus earnings reinvested in the business.

## 2. Earnings

- To analyze earnings, carefully study the company’s income statement. While earnings are undoubtedly important, security analysts have accorded them too much weight in calculating a company’s investment soundness. Management can manipulate a company’s earnings many ways. Therefore, always examine the firm’s income statement with a critical eye. For example, businesses can engineer nonrecurring charges and profits to produce a favorable earnings trend. A firm’s accountants also can generate perceived earnings by lowering or increasing the company’s reserves, or by reporting subsidiaries’ results in different ways. Companies can also present depreciation and amortization costs in a misleading manner.

- Investors must pay attention to more than current earnings. They should consider both the earnings trend and the long-term earnings average – preferably seven to ten years, putting more weight on the latter number. The analyst’s job is not predicting the future of a trend or intuiting possible price changes; it is making decisions based on facts.

## 3. Asset Value
- To gauge asset value, inspect the business’s balance sheet. A firm’s book value per share equals the total value of its tangible assets divided by the number of shares outstanding. Wall Street has almost entirely superseded the importance of asset value with earnings. Although rules of thumb for the proper ratio of market price to book value vary, you still should investigate the underlying value of a business’s assets before investing.

- The current-asset value – that is, current assets minus liabilities – is perhaps a more important number. It excludes both intangible assets and fixed assets and is, therefore, a rough approximation of the value of the company should it go in to liquidation. As a general rule, if a firm’s market price is below its liquidation value, the company has either been undervalued or it should be liquidated. Investors who can distinguish between the undervalued issues and the ones performing poorly due to fundamental unsoundness can realize a significant upside.

- In addition, examine the balance sheet to make sure that the company has an adequate cash position, that its current assets (exclusive of inventories) at least equal its current liabilities, and that it does not have a large amount of debt maturing soon, which could create refinancing problems.

- there should be no discount from the amount stated on the company's books for cash and marketable securities, provided the securities are short term or marked to the market. The same holds true for property, plant, and equipment
- economic value of the assets is the reproduction costs of a new firm starting out in the same industry.
  - we first find the current market prices for the securities. Then we must adjust the book value of the firm's accounts receivable and inventory up or down to get a more realistic reproduction costs

- it is important to note that goodwill represents a prior blunder that must be ignored when calculating the intrinsic value of a company.

- liabilities and equity are the sources of funds that support the assets, which are the uses to which those funds are put
- there are 3 types of liabilities
  - those that arise from the normal conduct of the business
  - those that arise from past circumstances that are not pertinent to a new entrant
  - the outstanding formal debt of the company.
- when we start with the reproduction cost of the assets and then subtract the first 2 categories of liabilities, we are left with the asset value of the whole enterprise.
- The defining character of a franchise is that it enables a firm to earn more than it needs to pay for the investments that fund its assets. The intrinsic value of a firm is either the reproduction costs of the assets, which should equal the EPV or those assets plus the competitive advantages of the firm that underlie its franchise. The initial judgment that has to be made is whether the firm currently has a competitive advantage, and, if so, how strong and sustainable it is

# The Relationship Between Owners and Managers
- The interests of shareholders and those of management do not always coincide. Most shareholders defer to the wisdom of management without demanding their rights as owners of the business. In the case of companies whose common stocks sell for less than the liquidating value, the shareholders may be best served by the liquidation of the company, but that would put management out of a job, so shareholders cannot depend on management to make the right decision. Investors need to educate themselves about management practices and take these lessons into account when making investments.

- Remember, however, that "analysis connotes the careful study of available facts with the attempt to draw conclusions therefrom based on established principles and sound logic. It is part of the scientific method. But in applying analysis to the field of securities, [you will] encounter the serious obstacle that investment is by nature not an exact science." Still, professional analysis is "not only useful, but indispensable."
