# Goals/Context

# Themes Found throughout the book
- Focusing on the differences between investing and speculating
  - failure to distinguish one from another has led to tragedies.
  - investments are bonds, outright purchases, permanent holding, for income, in safe securities.
  - speculations are stocks, purchases on margin, for a "quick turn", for profit, in risky issues.
  - specific standards have to be applied to give meaning to the term "safety"
  - an investment operation promises the safety of the principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.
  - an investment operation is one that can be justified on both qualitative and quantitative grounds.
  - investment is founded on the past and present, speculation relies on the future to improve.
  - for the investor, the future is to be guarded against rather than profit from.
  - for the speculator, he anticipates the future will be better than the past.
  - "intelligent speculation" is taking a measured risk that seems justified after analysis
  - "unintelligent speculation" is taking a risk without adequate examination of the situation
  - safety is measured in terms of the ability of the issuer to meet obligations
    - that ability should be assessed in terms of depression, not prosperity
  - lack of safety is not compensated by high dividends
  - Avoiding trouble is better than seeking protection after it occurs.
  - a sound investment must be able to withstand adversity. Enterprises that have withstood adversity may be favored by investors.
  - investment for profit, where growth is generally expected, the price is rarely reasonable.
  - the investor of small means may opt to step out of his role and become a speculator. He may also opt to regret his actions.
- Analysis skills
  - The term analysis indicates a scientific and methodical study of facts, which results in logical conclusions. But investment is not an exact science, and success derives in part from personal skills and chance.
  - analytical judgments are reached by applying standards to facts
  - analyst must preserve a sense of proportion, analyze what matters and ignore what trivial
