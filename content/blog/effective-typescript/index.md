# Understand the relationship between typescript and javascript

- If you're migrating an existing javascript codebase to typesript. It means that you don't have to rewrite any of your code in another language to start using TypeScript and get the benefits it provides.

- one of the goals of TypeScript's type system is to detect code that will throw an exception at runtime, without having to run your code. The type checker cannot always spot code that will throw exceptions, but it will try.

- type annotations tell TypeScript what your intent is, and this lets it spot places where your code's behavior does not match your intent.

- [typescript is superset of javascript](./ts-superset-js.png)

- Things to remember
  - TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. In other words, all JavaScript programs are already TypeScript programs. TypeScript has some syntax of its own, so typeScript programs are not, in general, valid JavaScript programs.
  - TypeScript adds a type system that models JavaScript's runtime behavior and tries to spot code which will throw exceptions at runtime. But you shouldn't expect it to flag every exception. It is possible for code to pass the type checker but still throw at runtime.
  - While TypeScript's type system largely models JavaScript behavior, there are some constructs that JavaScript allows but TypeScript chooses to bar, such as calling functions with the wrong number of arguments. This is largely a matter of taste.

# know which TypeScript Options You're Using

- if you mean to allow null, you can fix the error by making your intent explicit:
```javascript
const x: number | null = null;
```

- **Things to Remember**
  - The TypeScript compiler includes several settings which affect core aspects of the language.
  - Configure TypeScript using tsconfig.json rather than command-line. options.
  - Turn on noImplicit Any unless you are transitioning a JavaScript project to TypeScript.
  - Use strictNullChecks to prevent "undefined is not an object‚Äù- style runtime errors.
  - Aim to enable strict to get the most thorough checking that TypeScript can offer.

# understand that code generation is independent of types

- At a high level, tsc (the TypeScript compiler) does two things:
  - It converts next-generation TypeScript/JavaScript to an older version of JavaScript that works in browsers ("transpiling").
  - It checks your code for type errors.
- The types in your code cannot affect the JavaScript that TypeScript emits. Since it's this JavaScript that gets executed, this means that your types can't affect the way your code runs.
- Code with Type Errors Can Produce Output because Because code output is independent of type checking

```bash
$ cat test.ts
let x 'hello';
X = 1234;
$ tsc test.ts
test.ts:2:1- error TS2322: Type '1234' is not assignable to type 'string'
2 x = 1234;

$ cat test.js
var x = 'hello';
x = 1234;
```

- You can think of all TypeScript errors as being similar to warnings in those languages: it's likely that they indicate a problem and are worth investigating, but they won't stop the build.
  - It's better to say that your code has errors, or that it "doesn't type check."

- You should aim for zero errors when you commit code, lest you fall into the trap of having to remember what is an expected or unexpected error. If you want to disable output on errors, you can use the noEmitOnError option in tsconfig.json, or the equivalent in your build tool.

- **You Cannot Check TypeScript Types at Runtime**


- **Things to Remember**
  - Code generation is independent of the type system. This means that TypeScript types cannot affect the runtime behavior or performance of your code.
    - the TypeScript compiler will introduce build time overhead. The TypeScript team takes compiler performance seriously and compilation is usually quite fast, especially for incremental builds. If the overhead becomes significant, your build tool may have a "transpile only" option to skip the type checking.
    - The code that TypeScript emits to support older runtimes may incur a performance overhead vs. native implementations. For example, if you use generator functions and target ES5, which predates generators, then tsc will emit some helper code to make things work. This may have some overhead vs. a native implementation of generators. In any case, this has to do with the emit target and language levels and is still independent of the types.
```javascript
function as Number (val: number | string): number {
  return val as number;
}
// Looking at the generated JavaScript makes it clear what this function really does:
function as Number (val) {
  return val;
}

//There is no conversion going on whatsoever. The as number is a type operation, so it cannot affect the runtime behavior of your code. To normalize the value you'll need to check its runtime type and do the conversion using JavaScript constructs:
function asNumber (val: number | string): number {
  return typeof(val) === 'string' ? Number(val): val;
}
```

  - **runtime types may not be the same as declared types**
```javascript
function setLightSwitch (value: boolean) { 
  switch (value) {
    case true:
      turnLighton();
      break;
    case false:
      turnLightOff();
      break;
    default:
    console.log("Im afraid I cant do that.");
  }
}
// The key is to remember that boolean is the declared type. Because it is a TypeScript type, it goes away at runtime. In JavaScript code, a user might inadvertently call setLightSwitch with a value like "ON"
```

  - **You Cannot Overload a Function Based on TypeScript Types** 
    - Languages like C++ allow you to define multiple versions of a function that differ only in the types of their parameters. This is called "function overloading" Because the runtime behavior of your code is independent of its TypeScript types, this construct isn't possible in TypeScript:

```javascript
function add(a: number, b: number) { return a + b; } // Duplicate function implementation 
function add(a: string, b: string) { return a + b; } // Duplicate function implementation

// TypeScript does provide a facility for overloading functions, but it operates entirely at the type level. You can provide multiple declarations for a function, but only a single implementation:
function add (a: number, b: number): number;
function add (a: string, b: string): string;
function add (a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
const three add(1, 2); // Type is number
const twelve = add('1', '2'); // Type is string
//The first two declarations of add only provide type information. When TypeScript produces JavaScript output, they are removed, and only the implementation remains. 
```

  - It is possible for a program with type errors to produce code ("compile").
  - TypeScript types are not available at runtime. To query a type at runtime, you need some way to reconstruct it. Tagged unions and property checking are common ways to do this. Some constructs, such as class, introduce both a TypeScript type and a value that is available at runtime.
```javascript
//check for property example
function calculate Area (shape: Shape) {
if ('height' in shape) {
shape; // Type is Rectangle
return shape.width * shape.height;
} else {
shape; // Type is Square

// tagged unions example
interface Square {
  kind: 'square';
  width: number;
}
interface Rectangle {
  kind: 'rectangle';
  height: number;
  width: number;
}
type Shape = Square | Rectangle;

// class constructs introduce both a type and a value
class Square {
  constructor (public width: number) {}
}
class Rectangle extends Square {
  constructor (public width: number, public height: number) { super(width); }
}
type Shape = Square | Rectangle;
function calculateArea (shape: Shape) {
  if (shape instanceof Rectangle) {
    shape; // Type is Rectangle 
    return shape.width * shape.height;
  } else {
    shape;// Type is Square return shape.width
    return shape.width*shape.width; // OK
  }
}
//this works because class Rectangle introduces both a type and a value, whereas interface only introduced a type
//The Rectangle in type Shape = Square | Rectangle refers to the type, but the Rectangle in shape instanceof Rectangle refers to the value.
```

# get comfortable with structural typing javascript

- javascript is inherently duck typed: if you pass a function a value with all the right properties, it won't care how you made the value. It will just use it. ("If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck...")

- Understand that JavaScript is duck typed and TypeScript uses structural typing to model this: values assignable to your interfaces might have properties beyond those explicitly listed in your type declarations. Types are open and are not "sealed."


```javascript
// Say you're working on a physics library and have a 2D vector type:
interface Vector2D {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

//You write a function to calculate its length:
function calculateLength(v: Vector2D) { return Math.sqrt(v.x * v.x + v.y * v.y); }

// now you introduce the notion of a named vector
interface NamedVector { name: string;
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

//The calculateLength function will work with NamedVectors because they have x and y properties, which are numbers. TypeScript is smart enough to figure this out
const v NamedVector = {x: 3, y: 4, name: 'Zee' }; 
calculateLength (v); // OK, result is 5

//What is interesting is that you never declared the relationship between Vector2D and NamedVector. 
//And you did not have to write an alternative implementation of calculateLength for NamedVectors.
//It allowed calculateLength to be called with a NamedVector because its structure was compatible with Vector2D

// this can also lead to trouble with 3D vector type as  the calculateLength only use x, y (and ignore z) to calculate the length
interface Vector3D {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  z: number;
}


function calculateLengthL1 (v: Vector3D) { 
  let length = 0;
  for (const axis of Object.keys(v)) { 
    const coord = v[axis]; // Element implicitly has an 'any' type because
                           // 'string' can't be used to index type 'Vector3D'
    length + Math.abs (coord);
  }
  return length;
}
// this logic assumes that Vector3D is sealed and does not have other properties, but it could
const vec3D = {x: 3, y: 4, z: 1, address: '123 Broadway');
calculateLengthL1 (vec3D); // OK, returns NaN

//but in this case an implementation without loops would be better:
function calculate LengthL1 (v: Vector3D) { return Math.abs (v.x) + Math.abs (v. y) + Math.abs (v.z); }

// Structural typing can also lead to surprises with classes, which are compared structurally for assignability:
// Be aware that classes also follow structural typing rules. You may not have an instance of the class you expect!
class C { 
  foo: string; 
  constructor (foo: string) { this.foo = foo; }
}
const c = new C('instance of C'); 
const d: C = { foo: 'object literal' }; // OK!

// Structural typing is beneficial when you're writing tests.
// Say you have a function that runs a query on a database and processes the results:
interface Author {
  first: string;
  last: string;
}
function getAuthors (database: PostgresDB): Author[] {
  const authorRows = database.runQuery(`SELECT FIRST, LAST FROM AUTHORS`);
  return authorRows.map(row => ({first: row[0], last: row[1]}));
}

// To test this, you could create a mock PostgresDB. But a better approach is to use structural typing and define a narrower interface:
interface DB {
  runQuery: (sql: string) => any [];
}

function getAuthors (database: DB): Author[] { 
  const authorRows = database.runQuery(`SELECT FIRST, LAST FROM AUTHORS`);
  return authorRows.map(row => ({first: row[0], last: row[1]}));
}

//You can still pass getAuthors a PostgresDB in production since it has a runQuery method.
//Because of structural typing, the PostgresDB doesn't need to say that it implements DB.
test('getAuthors', () => {
  const authors = getAuthors ({ 
    runQuery(sql: string) {
      return [['Toni', 'Morrison'], ['Maya', 'Angelou']];
    }
  });

  expect (authors).toEqual([
    {first: 'Toni', last: 'Morrison'},
    {first: 'Maya', last: 'Angelou'}
  ]);
});

// TypeScript will verify that our test DB conforms to the interface. 
// And your tests don't need to know anything about your production database: no mocking libraries necessary!
// By introducing an abstraction (DB), we've freed our logic (and tests) from the details of a specific implementation (PostgresDB).
// Another advantage of structural typing is that it can cleanly sever dependencies between libraries.
```

# limit use of the any Type

- The "any type" effectively silences the type checker and TypeScript language services. It can mask real problems, harm developer experience, and undermine confidence in the type system. Avoid using it when you can!

- TypeScript's type system is *gradual and optional*: *gradual* because you can add types to your code bit by bit and *optional* because you can disable the type checker whenever you like. The key to these features is the any type:

```javascript
let age: number;
age = '12'; // Type "12" is not assignable to type 'number'
age = '12' as any; // OK
//The type checker is right to complain here, but you can silence it just by typing as any.
```

- **There's No Type Safety with any Types**
  - In the preceding example, the type declaration says that age is a number. But any lets you assign a string to it. The type checker will believe that it's a number (that's what you said, after all), and the chaos will go uncaught:

```javascript
age += 1; // OK; at runtime, age is now "121"
```

- **any Lets You Break Contracts**

  - When you write a function, you are specifying a contract: if the caller gives you a certain type of input, you'll produce a certain type of output. But with an any type you can break these contracts:

```javascript
function calculateAge (birthDate: Date): number { // ... 
}
let birthDate: any = '1990-01-19'; calculateAge (birthDate); // OK
```

- **There Are No Language Services for any Types**
  - When a symbol has a type, the TypeScript language services are able to provide intelligent autocomplete and contextual documentation  but for symbols with an any type, you're on your own

  - Renaming is another such service. If you have a Person type and functions to format a person's name:

```javascript
interface Person { first: string; last: string; }
const formatName = (p: Person) => `${p.first} ${p.last}`; const formatNameAny = (p: any) => `${p.first} ${p.last}`;
```

  - TypeScript's motto is "JavaScript that scales." A key part of "scales" is the language services, which are a core part of the TypeScript experience. Losing them will lead to a loss in productivity, not just for you but for everyone else working with your code.

- **any Types Mask Bugs When You Refactor Code**

```javascript
interface Component Props {
  onSelectItem: (item: any) => void;
}

// Here's code that manages that component:
function render Selector(props: ComponentProps) { /*...*/ }
let selectedId: number = 0;
function handleSelectItem(item: any) {
  selectedId= item. id;
}
renderSelector({onSelectItem: handleSelectItem});

//Later you rework the selector in a way that makes it harder to pass the whole item object through to onSelectItem. 
//But that's no big deal since you just need the ID. You change the signature in Component Props. It passed type checker but it produces runtime exception
interface Component Props { }
onSelectItem: (id: number) => void;
```

- **any Hides Your Type Design**

- **any Undermines Confidence in the Type System**

  - Every time you make a mistake and the type checker catches it, it boosts your confidence in the type system. But when you see a type error at runtime, that confidence takes a hit. If you're introducing TypeScript on a larger team, this might make your coworkers question whether TypeScript is worth the effort. any types are often the source of these uncaught errors.

  - TypeScript aims to make your life easier, but TypeScript with lots of any types can be harder to work with than untyped JavaScript because you have to fix type errors and still keep track of the real types in your head. When your types match reality, it frees you from the burden of having to keep type information in your head. TypeScript will keep track of it for you.


# Use Your Editor to Interrogate and Explore the Type System

- Take advantage of the TypeScript language services by using an editor that can use them.
Use your editor to build an intuition for how the type system works and how TypeScript infers types.

- Know how to jump into type declaration files to see how they model behavior.

- When you install TypeScript, you get two executables:
  - tsc, the TypeScript compiler
  - tsserver, the TypeScript standalone server

- configure the language services with your editor for services like autocomplete, inspection, navigation, and refactoring.

- if the inferred type does not match your expectation, you should add a type declaration and track down the discrepancy.

Seeing TypeScript's understanding of a variable's type at any given point is essential for building an intuition around widening (Item 21) and narrowing (Item 22). Seeing the type of a variable change in the branch of a conditional is a tremendous way to build confidence in the type system (see Figure 2-3).

```javascript
function logMessage(message: string | null) { 
  if (message) {
    // type of message is string | null outside the branch but string inside
    message
  }
}
```

```javascript
const foo = {
  //If your intention was for x to be a tuple type ([number, number, number]), then a type annotation will be required.
  //(property) x: number []
  x: [1, 2, 3],
  bar: {
  }
};
```

- Seeing type errors in your editor can also be a great way to learn the nuances of the type system. For example, this function tries to get an HTMLElement by its ID, or return a default one. TypeScript flags two errors:

```javascript
function getElement (el0rId: string| HTMLElement | null): HTMLElement { 
  if (typeof el0rId === 'object') { 
    // 'HTMLElement | null' is not assignable to 'HTMLElement'
    // The intent in the first branch of the if statement was to filter down
    // to just the objects, namely, the HTMLElements.
    // But oddly enough, in JavaScript typeof null is "object", 
    // so el0rId could still be null in that branch. 
    // You can fix this by putting the null check first. 
    return el0rId;
  } else if (el0rId === null) { 
    return document.body;
  } else {
    const el = document.getElementById(el0rId);
    // ~~~~~~~'HTMLElement | null' is not assignable to 'HTMLElement'
    // The second error is because document.getElementById can return null,
    // so you need to handle that case as well, perhaps by throwing an exception.
    return el;
  }
}
```
# think of types as sets of values

- Think of types as sets of values (the type's domain). These sets can either be finite (e.g., boolean or literal types) or infinite (e.g., number or string).

  - The smallest set is the empty set, which contains no values. It corresponds to the never type in TypeScript. Because its domain is empty, no values are assignable to a variable with a never type:

```javascript
const x: never = 12;
// Type '12' is not assignable to type 'never'
```

  - The next smallest sets are those which contain single values. These correspond to literal types in TypeScript, also known as unit types:

```javascript
type A = 'A';
type B = 'B';
type Twelve = 12;
// To form types with two or three values, you can union unit types:
type AB = 'A' | 'B'; 
type AB12 = 'A' | 'B' | 12;
// and so on. Union types correspond to unions of sets of values.
```
  - The word "assignable" appears in many TypeScript errors. In the context of sets of values, it means either "member of‚Äù (for a relationship between a value and a type) or "subset of" (for a relationship between two types):

  - At the end of the day, almost all the type checker is doing is testing whether one set is a subset of another

- Think of Identified interface as a description of the values in the domain of its type. Does the value have an id property whose value is assignable to (a member of) string? Then it's an Identified.

- Two ways of thinking of type relationships: as a hierarchy or as overlapping sets
- With the Venn diagram, it's clear that the subset/subtype/assignability relationships are unchanged if you rewrite the interfaces without extends:

- Typescript types form intersecting sets (a Venn diagram) rather than a strict hierarchy. Two types can overlap without either being a subtype of the other.
  - Remember that an object can still belong to a type even if it has additional properties that were not mentioned in the type declaration.

```javascript
interface Person { 
  name: string;
}
interface Lifespan {
  birth: Date;
  death? Date;
}
type PersonSpan = Person & Lifespan;
const ps: PersonSpan = {
  name: 'Alan Turing',
  birth: new Date('1912/06/23'),
  death: new Date('1954/06/07'), // OK
};
```

- Type operations apply to a set's domain. The intersection of A and B is the intersection of A's domain and B's domain. For object types, this means that values in A & B have the properties of both A and B.
  - Think of "extends," "assignable to," and "subtype of" as synonyms for "subset of."

```javascript
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}
type PointKeys = keyof Point; // Type is "x" | "y"
function sortBy<K extends keyof T, T>(vals: T[], key: K): T[] {}
const pts: Point[] = [{x: 1, y: 1}, {x: 2, y: 0}];
sortBy (pts, 'x'); // OK, 'x' extends'x'|'y' (aka keyof T)
sortBy (pts, 'y'); // OK, 'y' extends 'x'|'y'
sortBy(pts, Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'x': 'y'); // OK, 'x', 'y' extends 'x'|'y'
sortBy (pts, 'z'); //Type "z" is not assignable to parameter of type "x"|"y"

```

- What's the relationship between string|number and string|Date, for instance? Their intersection is non-empty (it's string), but neither is a subset of the other. The relationship between their domains is clear, even though these types don't fit into a strict hierarchy.
  - Union types may not fit into a hierarchy but can be thought of in terms of sets of values

- Thinking of types as sets can also clarify the relationships between arrays and tuples. 

```javascript
const list = [1, 2]; // Type is number[] 

// Type 'number[]' is missing the following properties from type
// [number, number]': 0, 1
const tuple: [number, number] = list; 
//The empty list and the list [1] are list of numbers which are not pairs of numbers. It therefore makes sense that number [] is not assignable to [number, number] since it's not a subset of it. (The reverse assignment does work.)

//'[number, number, number]' is not assignable to '[number, number]' 
//Types of property 'length are incompatible
//Type '3' is not assignable to type '2'
const triple: [number, number, number] [1, 2, 3];
const double: [number, number] = triple; 
//TypeScript models a pairs of numbers as {0: number, 1: number, length: 2}.
```

- Finally, it's worth noting that not all sets of values correspond to TypeScript types. There is no TypeScript type for all the integers, or for all the objects that have x and y properties but no others. You can sometimes subtract types using Exclude, but only when it would result in a proper TypeScript type:

```javascript
type T = Exclude <string | Date, string| number>; // Type is Date
type NonZeroNums = Exclude <number, 0> ; // Type is still just number
```

# prefer type declarations to type assertions

- Prefer type declarations `(: Type)` to type assertions `(as Type)`.

```javascript
const alice: Person = {}; 
// type '{}' Property 'name' is missing in but required in type 'Person'
const bob = {} as Person; // No error
```

```javascript
interface Person { name: string };
const alice: Person = { name: 'Alice' }; // Type is Person
const bob = { name: 'Bob' as Person; } // Type is Person
// The first (alice: Person) adds a type declaration to the variable 
// and ensures that the value conforms to the type. 
// The latter (as Person) performs a type assertion. 
// This tells TypeScript that, despite the type it inferred,
// you know better and would like the type to be Person.

// The same thing happens if you specify an additional property:
const alice: Person = { 
  name: 'Alice',
  occupation: 'TypeScript developer' 
  // Object literal may only specify known properties
  // and 'occupation' does not exist in type 'Person'
};

const bob = {
  name: 'Bob', 
  occupation: 'JavaScript developer'
} as Person; // No error
```

- Know how to annotate the return type of an arrow function.

```javascript
//It's tempting to use a type assertion here, and it seems to solve the problem:
const people = ['alice', 'bob', 'jan']
.map(name => ({name} as Person)); // Type is Person[]


//But this suffers from all the same issues as a more direct use of type assertions.
//For example:
const people = ['alice', 'jan'].map(name => ({} as Person)); // No error

//A more concise way is to declare the return type of the arrow function:
const people = ['alice', 'bob', 'jan'].map((name): Person => ({name})); 
// Type is Person []
```

- Use type assertions and non-null assertions when you know something about types that TypeScript does not.

```javascript
//For instance, you may know the type of a DOM element more precisely than TypeScript does:
document.querySelector('#myButton')
.addEventListener('click', e => {
  e.currentTarget // Type is Event Target 
  const button = e.currentTarget as HTMLButtonElement;
  button // Type is HTMLButtonElement 
//Because TypeScript doesn't have access to the DOM of your page,
//it has no way of knowing that #myButton is a button element.
//And it doesn't know that the currentTarget of the event should be that same button.
//Since you have information that TypeScript does not,
//a type assertion makes sense here
});

//You may also run into the non-null assertion,
//which is so common that it gets a special syntax:
const elNull = document.getElementById('foo'); // Type is HTMLElement | null 
const el = document.getElementById('foo')!; // Type is HTMLElement
//Used as a prefix, ! is boolean negation.
//But as a suffix, is interpreted as an assertion that the value is non-null.
//You should treat ! just like any other assertion: 
//it is erased during compilation, 
//so you should only use it if you have information that the type checker lacks
//and can ensure that the value is non-null.
//If you can't, you should use a conditional to check for the null case.


interface Person { name: string; } 
const body = document.body; 
const el = body as Person;
//Conversion of type 'HTMLElement' to type 'Person' may be a mistake
//because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional,
//convert the expression to 'unknown' first
const el = document.body as unknown as Person; // OK
```

# Avoid Object Wrapper Types (String, Number, Boolean, Symbol, BigInt)

- Understand how object wrapper types are used to provide methods on primitive values. Avoid instantiating them or using them directly.

- While a string primitive does not have methods, JavaScript also defines a String object type that does. JavaScript freely converts between these types. When you access a method like charAt on a string primitive, JavaScript wraps it in a String object, calls the method, and then throws the object away.

- Avoid TypeScript object wrapper types. Use the primitive types instead: string instead of String, number instead of Number, boolean instead of Boolean, symbol instead of Symbol, and bigint instead of BigInt.

```javascript
// Don't do this!
const originalCharAt = String.prototype.charAt; 
String.prototype.charAt = function(pos) { 
  console.log(this, typeof this, pos);
  return originalCharAt.call(this, pos);
};
console.log('primitive'.charAt(3));

// This produces the following output:
[String: 'primitive'] object 3
m

// The this value in the method is a String object wrapper, not a string primitive. 
// You can instantiate a String object directly and it will sometimes behave like a string primitive. But not always. For example, a String object is only ever equal to itself:
"hello" === new String("hello") -> false
new String("hello") === new String("hello") -> false

// The implicit conversion to object wrapper types explains an odd phenomenon in JavaScript-if you assign a property to a primitive, it disappears:
> x = "hello"
> x.language = 'English' 'English'
> x.language undefined
Now you know the explanation: x is converted to a String instance, the language property is set on that, and then the object (with its language property) is thrown away.
There are object wrapper types for the other primitives as well: Number for numbers, Boolean for booleans, Symbol for symbols, and BigInt for bigints (there are no object wrappers for null and undefined).
```

- As a final note, it's OK to call BigInt and Symbol without new, since these create primitives:

# Using Either/Result in TypeScript for Error Handling

- from [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/) library:

```typescript
import * as P from 'fp-ts/lib/pipeable';
import * as E from 'fp-ts/lib/Either';
import axios, { AxiosResponse, AxiosError } from 'axios';

// Custom error type
type ResponseError = string;

async function makeApiCall(): Promise<E.Either<ResponseError, AxiosResponse>> {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
    return E.right(response);
  } catch (error) {
    const axiosError = error as AxiosError;
    return E.left(`API Error: ${axiosError.response?.statusText || 'Unknown'}`);
  }
}

# Recognize the Limits of Excess Property Checking 

- When you assign an object literal to a variable or pass it as an argument to a function, it undergoes excess property checking.
- Excess property checking is an effective way to find errors, but it is distinct from the usual structural assignability checks done by the TypeScript type checker. Conflating these processes will make it harder for you to build a mental model of assignability.
- Be aware of the limits of excess property checking: introducing an intermediate variable will remove these checks.

```ts
//When you assign an object literal to a variable with a declared type, TypeScript makes sure it has the properties of that type and no others:
//you've triggered a process known as "excess property checking," which helps catch an important class of errors that the structural type system would otherwise miss
interface Room {
  numDoors: number;
  ceilingHeightFt: number;
}
const r: Room = {
  numDoors: 1,
  ceilingHeightFt: 10,
  elephant: 'present',
  //~`Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'elephant' does not exist in type 'Room'
};

//The elephant constant is assignable to the Room type, which you can see by introducing an intermediate variable:
//The type of obj is inferred as { numDoors: number; ceilingHeightFt: number; elephant: string}. Because this type includes a subset of the values in the
//Room type, it is assignable to Room, and the code passes the type checker
const obj = {
  numDoors: 1, 
  ceilingHeightFt: 10,
  elephant: 'present',
};
const r:
Room = obj; // OK, as the right hand side is not object literal

//TypeScript goes beyond trying to flag code that will throw exceptions at runtime. It also tries to find code that doesn't do what you intend. Here's an example of the latter:
interface Options {
  title: string;
  darkMode?: boolean;
}

function createWindow(options: Options) {
  if (options.darkMode) {
    setDarkMode();
  }
  // ...
}

createWindow({
  title: 'Spider Solitaire',
  darkmode: true
  // Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'darkmode' does not exist in type 'Options'.
  // Did you mean to write 'darkMode'?
});


// Excess property checking does not happen when you use a type assertion:
const o = { darkmode: true, title: 'Ski Free' } as Options; // OK
// This is a good reason to prefer declarations to assertions

// If you don't want this sort of check, you can tell TypeScript to expect additional properties using an index signature:
interface Options {
  darkMode?: boolean;
  [otherOptions: string]: unknown;
}
const o: Options = { darkmode: true }; // OK


//A related check happens for "weak" types, which have only optional properties:
interface LineChartOptions (
  logscale?: boolean;
  invertedYAxis?: boolean;
  areaChart?: boolean;
}
const opts = { logScale: true };
const o: LineChartOptions = opts;
// ~ Type '{ logScale: boolean; }' has no properties in common // with type 'LineChartOptions'
//For weak types like this, TypeScript adds another check to make sure that the value type and declared type have at least one property in common.
```


# Apply Types to Entire Function Expressions When Possible

- Consider applying type annotations to entire function expressions, rather than to their parameters and return type.
- If you're writing the same type signature repeatedly, factor out a function type or look for an existing one. If you're a library author, provide types for common callbacks.
- Use typeof fn to match the signature of another function.


```ts
JavaScript (and TypeScript) distinguishes a function statement and a function expression:
function rollDice1(sides: number): number {/..."/} // Statement
const rollDice2=function(sides: number): number {/*..*/ }; // Expression const rollDice3 = (sides: number): number => { /* ... */ }; // Also expression
An advantage of function expressions in TypeScript is that you can apply a type declaration to the entire function at once, rather than specifying the types of the parameters and return type individually:
type DiceRollFn = (sides: number) => number; const rollDice: DiceRollFn = sides => { /* ... /};
If you mouse over sides in your editor, you'll see that TypeScript knows its type is number. The function type doesn't provide much value in such a simple example, but the technique does open up a number of possibilities.
One is reducing repetition. If you wanted to write several functions for doing arithmetic on numbers, for instance, you could write them like this:
function add(a: number, b: number) { return a + b;} function sub(a: number, b: number) { return a-b;} function mul(a: number, b: number) { return a *b; } function div(a: number, b: number) { return a /b;}
or consolidate the repeated function signatures with a single function type:
type BinaryFn = (a: number, b: number) -> number;
const add: BinaryFn = (a, b) => a+b;
const sub: BinaryFn = (a, b) => a-b;
const mul: BinaryFn = (a, b) => a*b;
const div: BinaryFn = (a, b) => a/b;
This has fewer type annotations than before, and they're separated away from the function implementations. This makes the logic more apparent. You've also gained a check that the return type of all the function expressions is number.
Libraries often provide types for common function signatures. For example, ReactJS provides a MouseEventHandler type that you can apply to an entire function rather than specifying MouseEvent as a type for the function's parameter. If you're a library author, consider providing type declarations for common callbacks.
Another place you might want to apply a type to a function expression is to match the signature of some other function. In a web browser, for example, the fetch function issues an HTTP request for some resource:
const responseP - fetch('/quote?by-Mark Twain'); // Type is Promise<Response>
You extract data from the response via response.json() or response.text():
async function getQuote() {
const response = await fetch('/quote?by-Mark+Twain');
const quote = await response.json();
return quote;
}
1/1
// "quote": "If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.",
// "source": "notebook",
// "date": "1894"
There's a bug here: if the request for /quote fails, the response body is likely to contain an explanation like "404 Not Found." This isn't JSON, so response.json() will return a rejected Promise with a message about invalid JSON. This obscures the real error, which was a 404.
It's easy to forget that an error response with fetch does not result in a rejected Promise. Let's write a checkedFetch function to do the status check for us. The type declarations for fetch in lib.dom.d.ts look like this:
declare function fetch(
input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit
): Promise<Response>;
So you can write checked Fetch like this:
async function checked Fetch(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit){
const response = await fetch(input, init);
if (!response.ok){
// Converted to a rejected Promise in an async function
J
throw new Error('Request failed: ' + response.status); return response,
J
This works, but it can be written more concisely:
const checkedFetch: typeof fetch - async (input, init) => {
const response = await fetch(input, init);
if (!response.ok) {
throw new Error('Request failed:' + response.status);
return response,
We've changed from a function statement to a function expression and applied a type (typeof fetch) to the entire function. This allows TypeScript to infer the types of the input and init parameters.
The type annotation also guarantees that the return type of checkedFetch will be the same as that of fetch. Had you written return instead of throw, for example, TypeScript would have caught the mistake:
const checkedFetch: typeof fetch - async (input, init) => { Type 'Promise<Response [HTTPError>'
//
is not assignable to type 'Promise<Response>' Type 'Response HTTPError' is not assignable to type 'Response'
const response await fetch(input, init);
if (!response.ok) {
return new Error('Request failed:' + response.status);
J
return response;
J
The same mistake in the first example would likely have led to an error, but in the code that called checkedFetch, rather than in the implementation.
In addition to being more concise, typing this entire function expression instead of its parameters has given you better safety. When you're writing a function that has the same type signature as another one, or writing many functions with the same type signature, consider whether you can apply a type declaration to entire functions, rather than repeating types of parameters and return values.
```


# Know the Differences Between type and interface

- Understand the differences and similarities between type and interface.
- Know how to write the same types using either syntax.
- In deciding which to use in your project, consider the established style and whether augmentation might be beneficial.

```ts
If you want to define a named type in TypeScript, you have two options. You can use a type, as shown here:
type TState = {
name: string; capital: string;
or an interface:
interface IState { name: string;
}
capital: string;
(You could also use a class, but that is a JavaScript runtime concept that also introduces a value. See Item 8.)
Which should you use, type or interface? The line between these two options has become increasingly blurred over the years, to the point that in many situations you can use either. You should be aware of the distinctions that remain between type and interface and be consistent about which you use in which situation. But you should also know how to write the same types using both, so that you'll be comfortable reading TypeScript that uses either.
The examples in this item prefix type names with I or T solely to indicate how they were defined. You should not do this in your code! Prefixing interface types with I is common in C#, and this convention made some inroads in the early days of TypeScript. But it is considered bad style today because it's unnecessary, adds little value, and is not consistently followed in the standard libraries.
First, the similarities: the State types are nearly indistinguishable from one another. If you define an IState or a TState value with an extra property, the errors you get are character-by-character identical:
const wyoming: TState = {
name: "Wyoming',
capital: 'Cheyenne',
population: 500_000
//
//
//
};
~~ Type ... is not assignable to type 'TState' Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'population' does not exist in type 'TState'
You can use an index signature with both interface and type:
type TDict - {[key: string]: string};
}
interface IDict {
[key: string]: string;
You can also define function types with either:
type TFn = (x: number) -> string;
interface IFn {
(x: number): string;
const toStrT: TFn = x -> " + x; // OK const toStrl: IFn-x->+x; // OK
The type alias looks more natural for this straightforward function type, but if the type has properties as well, then the declarations start to look more alike:
type TFnWithProperties = {
J
(x: number): number;
prop: string;
interface IFnWithProperties {
J
(x: number): number;
prop: string;
You can remember this syntax by reminding yourself that in JavaScript, functions are callable objects.
Both type aliases and interfaces can be generic:
type TPair<T> = {
}
first: T;
second: T;
interface IPair<T> {
J
first: T;
second: T;
An interface can extend a type (with some caveats, explained momentarily), and a type can extend an interface: interface IState WithPop extends TState {
population: number;
type TState WithPop - IState & { population: number; };
Again, these types are identical. The caveat is that an interface cannot extend a complex type like a union type. If you want to do that, you'll need to use type and &.
A class can implement either an interface or a simple type:
class Statet implements TState {
J
J
name: string="
capital: string = ";
class Statel implements IState {
name: string="
capital: string = ";
Those are the similarities. What about the differences? You've seen one already there are union types but no union interfaces:
type AorB = 'a' | 'b';
An interface can extend some types, but not this one. Extending union types can sometimes be useful. If you have separate types for Input and Output variables and a mapping from name to variable:
type Input = { /* ... */};
type Output = {/...'));
interface VariableMap {
}
[name: string]: Input Output;




then you might want a type that attaches the name to the variable. This would be:
type NamedVariable = (Input | Output) & { name: string};
This type cannot be expressed with interface. A type is, in general, more capable than an interface. It can be a union, and it can also take advantage of more advanced features like mapped or conditional types.
It can also more easily express tuple and array types:
type Pair - (number, number);
type StringList = string[];
type NamedNums - [string,...number[]];
You can express something like a tuple using interface:
interface Tuple (
}
0: number;
1: number;
length: 2;
constt: Tuple -[10,20]; //OK
But this is awkward and drops all the tuple methods like concat. Better to use a type. For more on the problems of numeric indices, see Item
16.
An interface does have some abilities that a type doesn't, however. One of these is that an interface can be augmented. Going back to the State example, you could have added a population field in another way:
interface IState {
}
name: string;
capital: string;
interface IState {
population: number;
const wyoming: IState = {
name: "Wyoming',
capital: 'Cheyenne',
population: 500_000
}; // OK
This is known as "declaration merging," and it's quite surprising if you've never seen it before. This is primarily used with type declaration files (Chapter 6), and if you're writing one, you should follow the norms and use interface to support it. The idea is that there may be gaps in your type declarations that users need to fill, and this is how they do it.
TypeScript uses merging to get different types for the different versions of JavaScript's standard library. The Array interface, for example, is defined in lib.es5.d.ts. By default this is all you get. But if you add ES2015 to the lib entry of your tsconfig.json, TypeScript will also include lib.es2015.d.ts. This includes another Array interface with additional methods like find that were added in ES2015. They get added to the other Array interface via merging. The net effect is that you get a single Array type with exactly the right methods.
Merging is supported in regular code as well as declarations, and you should be aware of the possibility. If it's essential that no one ever augment your type, then use type.
Returning to the question at the start of the item, should you use type or interface? For complex types, you have no choice: you need to use a type alias. But what about the simpler object types that can be represented either way? To answer this question, you should consider consistency and augmentation. Are you working in a codebase that consistently uses interface? Then stick with interface. Does it use type? Then use type.
For projects without an established style, you should think about augmentation. Are you publishing type declarations for an API? Then it might be helpful for your users to be able to be able to merge in new fields via an interface when the API changes. So use interface. But for a
type that's used internally in your project, declaration merging is likely to be a mistake. So prefer type.

# Use Type Operations and Generics to Avoid Repeating Yourself

- The DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle applies to types as much as it applies to logic.
- Name types rather than repeating them. Use extends to avoid repeating fields in interfaces.
- Build an understanding of the tools provided by TypeScript to map between types. These include keyof, typeof, indexing, and mapped types.
- Generic types are the equivalent of functions for types. Use them to map between types instead of repeating types. Use extends to constrain generic types.
- familiarize yourself with generic types defined in the standard library such as Pick, Partial, and ReturnType

```ts
This script prints the dimensions, surface areas, and volumes of a few cylinders:
console.log('Cylinder 1 x 1',
'Surface area:', 6.283185*1*1+6.283185*1*1,
'Volume:', 3.14159*1*1*1);
console.log('Cylinder 1 x 2',
'Surface area:', 6.283185*1*1+6.283185*2*1,
'Volume:', 3.14159*1*2*1);
console.log('Cylinder 2 x 1',
'Surface area:', 6.283185*2*1+6.283185*2*1,
'Volume:', 3.14159*2*2*1);
Is this code uncomfortable to look at? It should be. It's extremely repetitive, as though the same line was copied and pasted, then modified. It repeats both values and constants. This has allowed an error to creep in (did you spot it?). Much better would be to factor out some functions, a constant, and a loop:
const surfaceArea = (r, h) -> 2* Math.PI*r* (r+h);
const volume = (r, h) => Math.PI*r*r*h;
for (const [r, h] of [[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1]]) {
}
console.log(
`Cylinder ${r) x ${h}',
Surface area: $(surfaceArea(r, h)}`,
Volume: ${volume(r, h)}');
This is the DRY principle: don't repeat yourself. It's the closest thing to universal advice that you'll find in software development. Yet developers who assiduously avoid repetition in code may not think twice about it in types:
interface Person {
}
firstName: string;
lastName: string;
interface PersonWithBirthDate {
}
firstName: string;
lastName: string; birth: Date;
Duplication in types has many of the same problems as duplication in code. What if you decide to add an optional middleName field to Person? Now Person and PersonWithBirthDate have diverged.
One reason that duplication is more common in types is that the mechanisms for factoring out shared patterns are less familiar than they are with code: what's the type system equivalent of factoring out a helper function? By learning how to map between types, you can bring the benefits of DRY to your type definitions.
The simplest way to reduce repetition is by naming your types. Rather than writing a distance function this way:



}
function distance(a: {x: number, y: number), b: {x: number, y: number}) {
return Math.sqrt((a.x-b.x)**2+(a.y - b.y)** 2);
create a name for the type and use that:
interface Point2D {
x: number;
y: number;
function distance(a: Point2D, b: Point2D) { /* ... */ }
This is the type system equivalent of factoring out a constant instead of writing it repeatedly. Duplicated types aren't always so easy to spot. Sometimes they can be obscured by syntax. If several functions share the same type signature, for instance:
function get(url: string, opts: Options): Promise<Response> {/*.....'%). function post(url: string, opts: Options): Promise<Response> {/*..*/}
Then you can factor out a named type for this signature:
type HTTPFunction (url: string, opts: Options) => Promise<Response>; const get: HTTPFunction (url, opts) => {/.../);
const post: HTTPFunction (url, opts) => {/...);
For more on this, see Item 12.
What about the Person/PersonWithBirth Date example? You can eliminate the repetition by making one interface extend the other:
interface Person {
}
}
firstName: string;
lastName: string;
interface Person WithBirthDate extends Person {
birth: Date;
Now you only need to write the additional fields. If the two interfaces share a subset of their fields, then you can factor out a base class with just these common fields. Continuing the analogy with code duplication, this is akin to writing PI and 2*PI instead of 3.141593 and 6.283185.
You can also use the intersection operator (&) to extend an existing type, though this is less common:
type PersonWithBirthDate = Person & { birth: Date};
This technique is most useful when you want to add some additional properties to a union type (which you cannot extend). For more on this, see Item 13.
You can also go the other direction. What if you have a type, State, which represents the state of an entire application, and another, TopNavState, which represents just a part?
interface State (
userld: string,
pageTitle: string;
recentFiles: string[];
pageContents: string;
interface TopNavState {
userld: string,
pageTitle: string;
recentFiles: string();
Rather than building up State by extending TopNavState, you'd like to define TopNavState as a subset of the fields in State. This way you can keep a single interface defining the state for the entire app.
You can remove duplication in the types of the properties by indexing into State:
type TopNavState = {
};
userid: State("userid");
pageTitle: State['pageTitle'];
recentFiles: State[recentFiles');
While it's longer, this is progress: a change in the type of pageTitle in State will get reflected in TopNavState. But it's still repetitive. You can do better with a mapped type:
type TopNavState -{
};
[k in 'userld''pageTitle' | 'recentFiles']: State[k]
Mousing over TopNavState shows that this definition is, in fact, exactly the same as the previous one (see Figure 2-10).
type TopNavState = { userId: string;
}
pageTitle: string; recentFiles: string[];
type TopNavState = {
}
[k in 'userId' | 'pageTitle' | 'recentFiles']: State [k]
Figure 2-10. Showing the expanded version of a mapped type in your text editor. This is the same as the initial definition, but with less duplication. Mapped types are the type system equivalent of looping over the fields in an array. This particular pattern is so common that it's part of the standard library, where it's called Pick:
type Pick<T, K>= {[k in K): T[k]};
(This definition isn't quite complete, as you will see.) You use it like this:
type TopNavState - Pick-State, 'userld' | 'pageTitle' | 'recentFiles'>;
Pick is an example of a generic type. Continuing the analogy to removing code duplication, using Pick is the equivalent of calling a function. Pick takes two types, T and K, and returns a third, much as a function might take two values and return a third.
Another form of duplication can arise with tagged unions. What if you want a type for just the tag?
interface SaveAction [
type: 'save';
II...
}



interface LoadAction {
}
type: 'load';
//....
type Action - SaveAction | LoadAction;
type ActionType = 'save' | 'load'; // Repeated types!
You can define ActionType without repeating yourself by indexing into the Action union:
type ActionType - Action['type']; // Type is "save" ("load"
As you add more types to the Action union, ActionType will incorporate them automatically. This type is distinct from what you'd get using Pick, which would give you an interface with a type property:
type ActionRec - Pick Action, 'type'>; // {type: "save" ["load"}
If you're defining a class which can be initialized and later updated, the type for the parameter to the update method will optionally include most of the same parameters as the constructor:
interface Options {
J
width: number;
height: number;
color: string;
label: string;
You can do so with typeof:
type Options=typeof INIT_OPTIONS;
This intentionally evokes JavaScript's runtime typeof operator, but it operates at the level of TypeScript types and is much more precise. For more on typeof, see Item 8. Be careful about deriving types from values, however. It's usually better to define types first and declare that values are assignable to them. This makes your types more explicit and less subject to the vagaries of widening (Item 21). Similarly, you may want to create a named type for the inferred return value of a function or method:
function getUserInfo(userId: string) {
II...
return {
userld,
}
width: number;
height: number;
color: string;
label: string;
interface OptionsUpdate {
width?: number;
height?: number;
}
color?: string;
label?: string;
class UIWidget {
}
constructor(init: Options) { /* ... */ }
update(options: OptionsUpdate) { /* ... */}
You can construct OptionsUpdate from Options using a mapped type and keyof:
type Options Update = {[k in keyof Options]?: Options[k]};
keyof takes a type and gives you a union of the types of its keys:
type OptionsKeys - keyof Options;
// Type is "width"/"height" ["color" | "label"
The mapped type ([k in keyof Options]) iterates over these and looks up the corresponding value type in Options. The ? makes each property optional. This pattern is also extremely common and is included in the standard library as Partial:
class UIWidget {
constructor(init: Options) { /*..*/}
name,
age, height, weight, favoriteColor,
// Return type inferred as (userId: string; name: string; age: number,...)
Doing this directly requires conditional types (see Item 50). But, as we've seen before, the standard library defines generic types for common patterns like this one. In this case the ReturnType generic does exactly what you want:
type UserInfo - ReturnType<typeof getUserInfo>;
Note that ReturnType operates on typeof getUserInfo, the function's type, rather than getUserInfo, the function's value. As with typeof, use this technique judiciously. Don't get mixed up about your source of truth.
Generic types are the equivalent of functions for types. And functions are the key to DRY for logic. So it should come as no surprise that generics are the key to DRY for types. But there's a missing piece to this analogy. You use the type system to constrain the values you can map with a function: you add numbers, not objects; you find the area of shapes, not database records. How do you constrain the parameters in a generic type?
You do so with extends. You can declare that any generic parameter extends a type. For example:
interface Name {
first: string;
last: string;
}
update(options: Partial<Options>) { /* ... */ }
}
You may also find yourself wanting to define a type that matches the shape of a value:
const INIT_OPTIONS - {
};
width: 640,
height:480,
color: '#00FF00",
label: 'VGA',
interface Options {
type DancingDuo<T extends Name> - [T, T];
const couple1: DancingDuo<Name> - [
{first: Fred', last: 'Astaire'},
{first: 'Ginger', last: 'Rogers"}
; //OK
const couple2: DancingDuo<{first: string}> = [
// Property 'last' is missing in type
//' first: string; )' but required in type 'Name' {first: 'Sonny'),
{first: 'Cher}
{first: string} does not extend Name, hence the error.


At the moment, TypeScript always requires you to write out the generic parameter in a declaration. Writing DancingDuo instead of DancingDuo<Name> won't cut it. If you want TypeScript to infer the type of the generic parameter, you can use a carefully typed identity
function:
const dancingDuo = <T extends Name>(x: DancingDuo<T>)=>x;
const couple1 = dancingDuo([
(first: "Fred', last: 'Astaire'},
{first: 'Ginger", last: 'Rogers']
D);
const couple2 = dancingDuo([
(first: 'Bono'),
{first: 'Prince'}
// Property 'last' is missing in type
// {first: string; )' but required in type 'Name'
D;
You can use extends to complete the definition of Pick from earlier. If you run the original version through the type checker, you get an error:
type Pick<T, K> = {
};
[k in K]: T[k]
//-Type 'K' is not assignable to type 'string / number / symbol
K is unconstrained in this type and is clearly too broad: it needs to be something that can be used as an index, namely, string | number | symbol. But you can get narrower than that-K should really be some subset of the keys of T, namely, keyof T:
type Pick<T, K extends keyof T> = {
[k in K]: T[k]
}; //OK
Thinking of types as sets of values (Item 7), it helps to read "extends" as "subset of" here.
As you work with increasingly abstract types, try not to lose sight of the goal: accepting valid programs and rejecting invalid ones. In this case, the upshot of the constraint is that passing Pick the wrong key will produce an error:
type FirstLast = Pick<Name, 'first' | 'last'>; // OK type FirstMiddle - Pick<Name, 'first' | 'middle'>;
// Type "middle" is not assignable
// to type "first" ["last"
Repetition and copy/paste coding are just as bad in type space as they are in value space. The constructs you use to avoid repetition in type space may be less familiar than those used for program logic, but they are worth the effort to learn. Don't repeat yourself!
```

# Apply Types to Entire Function Expressions When Possible

## Things to Remember

- Consider applying type annotations to entire function expressions, rather than to their parameters and return type.
- If you're writing the same type signature repeatedly, factor out a function type or look for an existing one.
- If you're a library author, provide types for common callbacks.
- Use `typeof fn` to match the signature of another function, or `Parameters` and a rest parameter if you need to change the return type.


## Code Samples

```ts
function rollDice1(sides: number): number { /* ... */ }  // Statement
const rollDice2 = function(sides: number): number { /* ... */ };  // Expression

# Understand Evolving any

- example 1:
```javascript
const result = [];  // Type is any[]
result.push('a');
result  // Type is string[]
result.push(1);
result  // Type is (string | number)[]
```

- Implicit any types do not evolve through function calls. The arrow function here trips up inference:

```javascript
function makeSquares(start: number, limit: number) {
  const out = [];
     // ~~~ Variable 'out' implicitly has type 'any[]' in some locations
  range(start, limit).forEach(i => {
    out.push(i * i);
  });
  return out;
      // ~~~ Variable 'out' implicitly has an 'any[]' type
}
```
  - In cases like this, you may want to consider using an array's map and filter methods to build arrays in a single statement and avoid iteration and evolving any entirely


- **Things to Remember**
  - While TypeScript types typically only refine, implicit any and any[] types are allowed to evolve. You should be able to recognize and understand this construct where it occurs.
  - For better error checking, consider providing an explicit type annotation instead of using evolving any.

# push null values to the perimeter of your types

- example 1:
  - avoid
```javascript
let min, max;
...
return [min, max];
```
  - better approach would be:
```javascript
let result: [number, number] | null = null;
...
return result;
```

- mix of null and non-null values can also lead to problems in classes. For example
```javascript
class UserPosts {
  user: UserInfo | null;
  posts: Post [] | null;

  constructor () {
    this.user = null;
    this.posts = null;
  }

  async init(userId: string) {
    return Promise.all([
      async () => this.user = await fetchUser(userId),
      async () => this.posts = await fetchPostsForUser(userId)
    ]);
  }
}
```
  - better design would wait until all the data used by the class is available
```javascript
class UserPosts {
  user: UserInfo;
  posts: Post [];

  constructor () {
    this.user = null;
    this.posts = null;
  }

  async init(userId: string) {
    const [user, posts] = Promise.all([
      async () => this.user = await fetchUser(userId),
      async () => this.posts = await fetchPostsForUser(userId)
    ]);
    return new UserPosts(user, posts);
  }
}
```

- don't be tempted to replace nullable properties with promises. This tends to lead to even more confusing code and forces all your methods to be async. Promises clarify the code that loads data but tend to have the opposite effect on the class that uses that data.

- **Things to Remember**
  - Avoid designs in which one value being null or not null is implicitly related to another value being null or not null.
  - Push null values to the perimeter of your API by making larger objects either null or fully non-null. This will make code clearer both for human readers and for the type checker.
  - Consider creating a fully non-null class and constructing it when all values are available.
  - While strictNullChecks may flag many issues in your code, it's indispensable for surfacing the behavior of functions with respect to null values.


# Avoid Cluttering Your Code with Inferable Types

- example 1:

Don‚Äôt write:

```javascript
let x: number = 12;
```

Instead, just write:

```javascript
let x = 12;
```

- example 2:

Instead of:

```javascript
const person: {
  name: string;
  born: {
    where: string;
    when: string;
  };
  died: {
    where: string;
    when: string;
  }
} = {
  name: 'Sojourner Truth',
  born: {
    where: 'Swartekill, NY',
    when: 'c.1797',
  },
  died: {
    where: 'Battle Creek, MI',
    when: 'Nov. 26, 1883'
  }
};
```
you can just write:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Sojourner Truth',
  born: {
    where: 'Swartekill, NY',
    when: 'c.1797',
  },
  died: {
    where: 'Battle Creek, MI',
    when: 'Nov. 26, 1883'
  }
};
```

- example 3:

instead of:

```javascript
interface Product {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
}

function logProduct(product: Product) {
  const id: number = product.id;
  const name: string = product.name;
  const price: number = product.price;
  console.log(id, name, price);
}
```

you can just write:

```javascript
interface Product {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
}

function logProduct(product: Product) {
  const {id, name, price} = product;
  console.log(id, name, price);
}
```

- example 4:

```javascript
// Don't do this:
app.get('/health', (request: express.Request, response: express.Response) => {
  response.send('OK');
});
```

```javascript
// Do this:
app.get('/health', (request, response) => {
  response.send('OK');
});
```

- There are a few situations where you may still want to specify a type even where it can be inferred.

  - when you define an object literal
```javascript
const elmo: Product = {
  name: 'Tickle Me Elmo',
  id: '048188 627152',
  price: 28.99,
};
```
    - When you specify a type on a definition like this, you enable excess property checking. This can help catch errors, particularly for types with optional fields.
    - You also increase the odds that an error will be reported in the right place (type error where it's defined vs type error where it's used)

  - You may still want to annotate return type even when it can be inferred to ensure that implementation errors don't leak out into uses of the function.
    - Writing out the return type may also help you think more clearly about your function: you should know what its input and output types are before you implement it. While the implementation may shift around a bit, the function's contract (its type signature) generally should not. This is similar in spirit to test-driven development (TDD), in which you write the tests that exercise a function before you implement it. Writing the full type signature first helps get you the function you want, rather than the one the implementation makes expedient.

- If you are using a linter, the eslint rule no-inferrable-types (note the variant spelling) can help ensure that all your type annotations are really necessary.

# Don‚Äôt Repeat Type Information in Documentation

- example 1:

```javascript
/**
 * Returns a string with the foreground color.
 * Takes zero or one arguments. With no arguments, returns the
 * standard foreground color. With one argument, returns the foreground color
 * for a particular page.
 */
function getForegroundColor(page?: string) {
  return page === 'login' ? {r: 127, g: 127, b: 127} : {r: 0, g: 0, b: 0};
}
```

better declaration and comment might look like this:

```javascript
interface Color {
  r: number;
  g: number;
  b: number;
}

/** Get the foreground color for the application or a specific page. */
function getForegroundColor(page?: string): Color {
  // ...
}
```

- Example 2:

```javascript
/** Does not modify nums */
function sort(nums: number[]) { /* ... */ }
```

declare it readonly and let TypeScript enforce the contract

```javascript
function sort(nums: readonly number[]) { /* ... */ }
```

- Avoid repeating type information in comments and variable names. In the best case it is duplicative of type declarations, and in the worst it will lead to conflicting information.

- Consider including units in variable names if they aren't clear from the type (e.g., timeMs or temperatureC).
