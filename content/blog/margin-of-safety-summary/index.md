- Value investing has a long record of excellent returns with limited downside risk.
- It’s a book about how to think about investing — you have to understand why value investing works. It’s not enough to know the rules behind it, but understand why the rules work, when they work, and when they don’t.
- Wall Street Misbehavior: short term focused, driven by the volume of activity, ignorant of business fundamentals, casino operator, pushing index strategies designed to avoid volatility at the cost of mediocre returns.
- Institutional Investor Misbehavior: short term focused, driven by performance pressure, compensation, and career risk, which pushes relative performance and fad chasing.
- Investors Misbehavior: they are their own worst enemies — greed, fear, and other emotions cause investors to ignore fundamentals when making decisions.
- Misbehavior creates opportunities for value investors.
- You can treat stocks as pieces of paper to be traded based on guessing its next price move or you can treat stocks as ownership in a business.
- The greatest challenge is patience and discipline.
- Investors profit by:
  - Free cash flow made by the business.
  - Increase in the multiple paid that’s reflected in the share price.
  - Share price moves closer to the value of the business.
- Speculation:
  - Trading Sardines versus Eating Sardines: The story goes that sardines once thrived off the coast of Monterey, California until one day they disappeared. The commodity traders bid up the price of sardines and canned sardine prices soared. One day, a commodity trader helped himself to a can, opened it, and began eating. He quickly got sick. The sardines were no good. To which his friend replied, “These are not eating sardines, they are trading sardines.”
  - Speculation can erupt anytime, anywhere, and not be recognized until much later, and after much money has been invested and lost.
  - Driven by instant gratification: getting rich quickly is more appealing than getting rich slowly.
Greater Fool Game: buying a stock with the hopes a greater fool will quickly take it off your hands at a higher price.
  - Lazy Game: requires no analysis or information about the business. It’s guessing what other investors will do, and try to do it first.
  - Collectibles are a speculative game since prices are driven by taste, not free cash flows.

- Winchester Disk Drive Mania:
  - 43 Winchester disk driver manufacturers received venture funding between 1977 and 1984.
  - By mid-1983, 12 of the publicly traded manufacturers of disk drives were valued at $5 billion in total.
  - There was no chance all 12, much less 43, would dominate the market — only a few might survive. Nor would the market be remotely worth $5 billion in the future (based on a study done in 1983).
  - By 1984, the total market of the 12 public companies was down to $1.5 billion.
- Mr. Market: is a helpful fellow. Every day he’s ready to buy or sell securities at a price he set that minute. Sometimes the prices are reasonable. Sometimes, emotion gets the best of him. He becomes optimistic or pessimistic and his prices reflect it. If you look to Mr. Market for guidance, thinking his prices hold meaning, it can lead to speculation and loss. Beware: Mr. Market’s prices hold no hidden meaning. He knows nothing. It’s only the collective action of millions of buyers and sellers whose actions aren’t always motivated by fundamentals. You can take advantage of Mr. Market’s frequent emotional moments or do nothing. It’s your choice.
- Why security prices move (up and down):
  - To reflect reality or changes in perception of reality.
  - Short term changes in supply and demand.
- Not all market selloffs are buying opportunity.
- Wall Street has a bullish bias. An optimistic case can be made for any security, and often is made. It’s also more enjoyable for management and investors to hear the optimistic view. But a focus on optimistic outcomes comes with a cost of ignoring risk.
- Financial Innovation: early success does not equate to being good. It often looks better early on, but the merits of any financial innovation must be determined over the course of a full market cycle. Problems often take time to surface. What’s lauded as a new improved way to invest is really just a fad — one that could be taken to an extreme.
- Investment Fads: investors slap optimistic growth numbers on new technology, products, etc. that don’t fit reality. Unsustainable multiples are the end result. Market history is filled with optimistic fads that failed to live up to expectations and came to an abrupt end. The cycle of fads is a byproduct of investor behavior and unlikely to end.
- Career Risk: some fund managers invest to protect their jobs which can lead to groupthink, herd mentality, and mediocre returns closer to their benchmark (and underperform after fees). Because the risk of trying to earn the best return possible over the long run comes with the risk of underperformance, that might not sit well with investors. It leads to a short-term relative performance bias.
- Be wary of fund managers who don’t (won’t) invest their own money in funds they run.
- To be fully invested or not should depend on the number of available opportunities. Doing nothing — not being fully invested — is a smart option when opportunities are lacking.
- Why understand institutional investors?
  - They dominate the market, so their behavior has a big impact on markets.
  - Institutional investors are often too big to invest in certain areas of the market that, in turn, offer rewarding opportunities for smaller investors.
- Junk Bond Mania:
  - Junk bonds were sold as a new innovation in the 1980s that took on manic proportions. Initially hailed as “safe” investments but by 1990 defaults hit record levels.
  - W. Braddock Hickman showed, via a study, that a portfolio of low quality, high yield bonds could outperform a high-quality bond portfolio. The higher rates more than compensated for defaults and losses. It worked because enough investors avoided low-quality bonds, causing depressed prices. Price appreciation, not yields, was behind the better return. The real opportunity was in bonds priced to default — fallen angels selling well below par — which then improved and recovered.
  - Milken took the idea that high-yield bonds outperformed, pushed it excess, but left out the important point of depressed prices.
  - Milken claimed low-rated bonds earned a historically higher return than highly-rated bonds. He also claimed that the risk was low because losses from defaults were easily compensated by higher yields. And he claimed liquidity wouldn’t be a problem.
  - Unlike fallen angels selling below par, Milken’s newly issued junk bonds were sold at par value. There was no chance of price appreciation. They were already priced for perfection (survival). New junk bonds came onto the market with limited upside and a big risk of default and loss.
  - Because junk bonds were a new concept, the default rate was deceptively low for two reasons: defaults can take time and the number of defaults lagged behind the number of junk bond issuances — the denominator (# of junk bond issuances) outgrew the numerator (# of defaults). The true default rate was only uncovered once new issues slowed and ceased.
  - The deceptively low default rate was used to promote the “junk bonds are safe” narrative. High yields for little or no risk become a big selling point that quickly caught on. The high demand allowed junk bonds to be issued by virtually anyone looking to borrow money, from unsound small businesses in need of debt to corporate takeovers artists.
  - A study on the interest coverage ratio of newly issued junk bonds had fallen to below 1 by 1988. Pretax earnings were less than the interest expense on new issues. Debt to net assets tripled over the same period.
  - Newly created high-yield bond funds helped drive demand and forced their competition, which held higher-quality bonds, to swap high-quality for high-yield in order to compete.
  - A few thrifts (S&Ls) used junk bonds, along with other risky assets, to offer a higher interest rate on accounts and grow their deposits, but it ultimately led to their insolvency and the S&L crisis.
  - Interest rate resets became a widely used feature on junk bonds — it’s a promise that the issuer will reset the coupon at a specific date to cause it to trade around a specific price.
  - EBITDA became the proxy for free cash flow when valuing highly leveraged businesses. Which led to flawed analysis and overvaluation. If interest is large enough, like it was at the time, no earnings would exist.
- “If a historically accepted investment yardstick proves to be overly restrictive, the path of least resistance is to invent a new standard.”
- Avoiding loss should be the first goal. That does not mean no losses of any kind. A portfolio, over time, should not be exposed to the chance of significant losses.
- A loss avoidance strategy is not about having a fixed allocation to certain securities or having a fixed return goal to meet. It’s about knowing that unexpected things happen, risks always change, so you have to be prepared for that eventuality.
- Risk depends on the price paid for a security.
- “the effects of compounding even moderate returns over many years are compelling, if not downright mind-boggling.”
- Compounding requires perseverance in order to succeed. It’s important to avoid extreme losses since it can quickly wipe out years of compounding that has built up.
- “Investors intent on avoiding loss consequently must position themselves to survive and even prosper under any circumstances.”
- Because the future is unpredictable, it’s impossible to know what markets will do next. Or the economy. Or interest rates. Bad luck, mistakes, rare catastrophes, and crises do happen. Investors need to be prepared for when these unexpected surprises happen again.
- Value investing is buying dollars for 50 cents — buying securities at a discount to their underlying value. It combines a conservative value analysis with the discipline to only buy when a discount to value is significant.
- Buffett’s baseball analogy: Investors have no called strikes. Nobody’s keeping track of the number of pitches you see. You don’t have to swing at any pitch (investments). You can patiently stand at the plate with the bat on your shoulder, waiting for the perfect pitches — the ones you’re most comfortable with, that you understand the most.
- New investments must be weighed against other available opportunities and existing holdings. It ensures that your portfolio is always made up of the best opportunities. That means no investment is sacred, especially if a better one comes along.
- Be comfortable with imperfect information because you’ll never know everything about an investment. And if you did know everything, then the opportunity is likely gone because the market already priced it in.
- Ways to protect from declining business values:
  - Always do conservative valuations, with the worst-case scenario or liquidation value in mind.
  - Require a wider margin of safety — a deeper discount to fair value — to account for risks like deflation that lower the value of an investment.
  - Catalysts, that offer a time frame to realize value, help offset uncertainty that comes with the typical unknown time horizon for most investments.
- Margin of Safety:
  - allows for imperfection, error, bad luck, or excessive volatility in order to avoid big losses.
  - The difference between price and fair value is your margin of safety. The wider the difference, the wider margin, the more protected you are from surprises.
  - Preservation of capital is built-in and necessary because valuation is imperfect, the future is unpredictable, and people make mistakes.
  - Margin of safety can be improved by replacing a current holding with better opportunities, selling once value is mostly realized, and holding cash when no significant bargains exist.
- It’s important to know why an investment is undervalued and to sell when it no longer applies.
- Look for management that puts their own money at risk in the business.
- Bear markets are the real test of an investment philosophy.
- In market declines, stocks are often priced as if nothing can go right. They have the widest margin of safety and the lowest amount of risk because the worst-case scenario is priced in. They also have the highest upside. When focus and expectations shift from the worst-case to the strength of business fundamentals, the market will send prices higher.
- Value investing is:
  - Based on bottom-up analysis – it makes it easier to know when the reason why behind an investment no longer applies.
  - Absolute over relative performance – allows investments to be judged on their own merits, while not worrying about what the market is doing in the short term.
  - Focused on what can go wrong over what can go right – keeps risk front of mind and helps to avoid losses.
- Risk can’t be reduced to a number. Risk is weighed by imperfect analysis — the probability and amount of potential loss for any investment include unknowns. It’s why a margin of safety, diversification, and hedging are important.
- Opportunity Cost: Build a portfolio with opportunity cost in mind. Holding some cash or securities that throw off cash in a portfolio helps offset opportunity costs. Investments with catalysts, like risk-arbitrage, tend to be short term in nature which also helps as investments are sold for cash plus profits.
- Business Valuation:
  - Business valuation is an art. It’s imperfect. It changes with micro- and macroeconomic changes. Assumptions of future cash flows can be made down to the penny. Just because you can discount future cash flows out to the nth decimal place doesn’t make the calculation precise or accurate.
  - Ben Graham sought to find a valuation that is adequate.
  - Markets are the collective result of a difference of opinion. Buyers place the value of a security higher than what they paid. Sellers put the value lower than they’re selling price. They both feel they’re getting a deal. The buyer and seller likely differ on their assumptions of the future cash flows, the discount rate, etc. leading to a range in valuation. The true value likely falls somewhere in between.
  - Discount future cash flows (NPV analysis) can be a very accurate valuation method. But…less than certain cash flows, inaccurate growth forecasts, and arbitrary discount rates can be problematic and imprecise.
  - More stable businesses tend to be more predictable (not always) but the predictability means it’s less likely to be selling at a deep discount.
  - Many factors go into a business’s growth, making it difficult to predict — unit sales, population growth, product usage, market share, price increase…
  - Biases — optimism or pessimism — influencing the numbers will throw the valuation further off. Too much optimism in projections could mean that everything has to go right for the projections to work out or losses are certain.
  - Conservative assumptions are the only solution to the problem of inaccurate valuations. Then invest at a discount to the conservative valuation.
  - There is no correct discount rate — it depends on: the investor’s risk profile, the riskiness of the investment, and alternative investment options.
  - The dividend discount method can ignore a large percentage of total cash flows and projecting dividends far into the future often ignores the chance of cuts or accuracy in predicting raises.
  - Private market valuation – must ignore inflated prices paid in takeovers when using private market valuation.
  - Liquidation Value (net-net working capital) — current assets minus current and long-term liabilities. Offers protection — worst-case scenario — if bought below liquation value. Beware of operations that can quickly burn through current assets, underfunded pensions, environmental laws around plant closings, etc.
  - Relative valuation: is a yardstick for assessing how the market values businesses in a similar industry today. Useful in assessing how the market might value a subsidiary or spinoff.
  - Which valuation method to use? It depends on the situation.
  - Earnings per share is imprecise, hard to project, and can be manipulated. Nonrecurring earnings (one-time items) should be ignored as it inflates earnings. Earnings (or cash flow) is just one way to understand what’s going on inside a business.
  - Book value can be imprecise depending on the asset in question. Current assets are generally accurately valued. Building, plant, and equipment may not be. Outside factors like inflation, technology innovation, regulation can affect asset value too that can’t be easily assessed — not always negatively. Regulations may introduce scarcity making an old plant more valuable due to the higher cost of building a new one. Book value is only one piece in an analysis.
  - Dividend yield can be deceptive. A high yield might look attractive but is likely the result of a fallen stock price…with a potential dividend cut priced in. The company’s ability to survive a prolonged downturn and pay a dividend needs to assessed along with yield.
- Theory of Reflexivity — stock price can influence business value:
  - When a business needs additional capital, stock price determines its success. With a high stock price, built on optimism, the market might see new share issuance as a positive. Whereas with a low stock price, a new issuance might be viewed negatively or not be possible.
  - When management sees stock prices, not fundamentals, determine valuation.
  - Reflexivity is a wild card — occasionally very important.
- Value Investing Niches:
  - Discount to Liquidation Value — net-net working capital.
  - Rate-of-Return Situations: where time frame and exit prices are more predictable — risk arbitrage around mergers, tender offers, etc. where a catalyst is involved.
  - Asset Conversions: distressed debt, bankruptcies, recapitalization, and exchange offers.
- It’s important that investors figure out why a bargain became a bargain. Ask: What’s wrong with it? What are the flaws? The reason may help decide how predictable the outcome is and whether its a better or worse investment because of it.
- Value investing is contrarian, investing against the herd, avoiding what’s popular, searching for the ignored and unloved securities. Because of this, value investors almost always look wrong and experience paper losses at first — get used to it. Eventually, opinions and trends change, the unloved become loved, and security prices rise to fair value.
- “First, no matter how much research is performed, some information always remains elusive; investors have to learn to live with less than complete information. Second, even if an investor could know all the facts about an investment, he or she would not necessarily profit.”
- Fundamental analysis is subject to diminishing returns.
- The 80/20 rule: 80% of available information is found in the first 20% of the time spent searching.
- Low prices come with high uncertainty. Waiting for perfect information leads to missed opportunities (once all information is available, prices have risen). Investors buying at low prices in uncertain times, often do so at a wider margin of safety, that provides protection from the added risk of uncertainty, and still get rewarded.
- Buying along with insiders can be profitable. Watch for insider buying, with their own money, in the open market. Insiders have many reasons to sell, but only one reason to buy.
- Catalysts help reduce risk. Since catalysts come with a defined time frame, value realization happens quicker and lowers the chance of loss in the process.
- Catalysts for total value realization: liquation or sale of the business.
- Catalysts for partial value realization: spinoffs, recapitalizations, buybacks, asset sales.
- Complex Securities: securities with unusual contractual cash flow characteristics tied to a contingent event. Often rare, unusual, and hard to evaluate, which leads investors to avoid entirely, limiting demand and creating value. Klarman gives several examples:  participation certificates, certain preferred stock with unusual features, contingent-value rights, and rights offerings.
- Risk Arbitrage: gain/loss depends on the completion of a takeover deal. Returns are determined by the spread between the price paid and the amount paid on completion of the deal. The downside is the transaction or deal fails. Goes through periods of popularity. Periods of high uncertainty can make risk arbitrage opportunities attractive.
- All investment philosophies and niche strategies go through a cycle of popularity. When a strategy becomes popular, it sees more money flow in, increases buying, higher prices, and reduces future returns. A period of poor returns sees money outflows, prices fall, popularity wanes, and raises future returns.
- Spinoffs result when a parent company distributes shares in a subsidiary to its existing shareholder. It’s often an attempt by management to unlock value — where the parts are greater than the combined business. Spinoffs can be underfollowed, often small-caps, that are quickly sold by existing shareholders for a number of reasons. It can lead to undervalued opportunities in the spinoff or the parent company.
- A conservative valuation is more important in highly leveraged businesses.
- Distressed/Bankrupt Securities: difficult to analyze and come with a stigma around bankruptcy that keeps most investors out of these securities. It creates attractive opportunities with debt selling way below par. Companies that file for bankruptcy have hit bottom — nowhere to go but up, once lenders are satisfied and new financing becomes available. But it requires caution. Not all companies recover to their former glory.
- Financial Distress Scenarios (must consider the possibility of each):
  - Continue payment of principal and interest.
  - Exchange new securities for those outstanding.
  - Default and file for bankruptcy.
  - (Cost-cutting, asset sales, or outside capital are other short-term options considered by management before the above scenarios. It can lead to a worsening of the long term business value.)
- Bondholders, unlike shareholders, can’t be forced to go along with an exchange offer or other deal by the majority of bondholders who agree to it. There’s an upside and downside in holding out — like the Prisoner’s Dilemma. Often creditors will agree to a plan in advance of bankruptcy.
- Senior securities, during a bankruptcy, often move independent of the market, since it’s tied to the progress of the reorganization.
- Three Stages of Bankruptcy:
  - After Chapter 11 filing: highest uncertainty, lowest information, greatest opportunity (if it exists) — the financial situation is uncertain, financial statements missing/late, liabilities are not obvious, securities prices highly volatile, and debt holders may be forced to sell.
  - Negotiation of reorganization plan: months to years to reach this point — the financial situation is known but uncertainty exists around the plan and how each creditor class will fair.
  - Finalization of a plan and emerging from bankruptcy: takes three months to a year — closer to a risk-arbitrage dependent on final approval, plan being contested or rejected by a creditor or plan falls through.
- Financial Distressed Securities: requires patience, returns are dependent on timing, often illiquid, price must be the primary focus.

- Financial Distress Valuation:
  - Starts with valuing the assets, split into two groups — current assets (cash, investment securities, assets held for sale) and assets of the operating business.
  - Account for any income statement or cash flow distortions like interest expense not being paid, costs of Chapter 11, etc. that will or won’t exist once out of bankruptcy.
  - Look at off-balance sheet assets — real estate carried below value, pension fund, patents, claims owed to IRS, EPA, PBGC, etc.
  - Analyze liabilities in descending order — may find opportunities at each level of debt structure, senior debt being less risky, junior debt offering greater returns but a higher risk of loss. Common stock should be avoided.

- Duration must be assessed with liquidity risk. Investors should be compensated more for the risk of holding an illiquid investment over a longer period of time.
- Liquidity is dependent on the availability of buyers and sellers. Liquidity is prevalent in normal markets, non-existent in panics.
- Finding the right balance for a portfolio between liquidity and illiquidity, low risk and high risk, low return and high return can be tricky.
- A portfolio with systematic liquation or cash flows built-in – via dividends or sales — can help avoid complacency and add a challenge of always looking for best available bargains.
- Portfolio management should be about risk reduction. Reducing risk at the portfolio level, while accounting for risk in individual investments.
- There’s a fine line between diversification and over-diversification. 10-15 holdings is enough for Klarman.
- Market risk can be limited by hedging, but can also be costly.
- Opportunity is a function of price.

- Klarman recommends buying partial positions and averaging down if price declines. If your analysis is good, you should want to own more at a lower price.
- Selling is the hardest part:
  - Since valuation is imperfect, knowing what price to sell at is also imperfect.

- Should be based on underlying value, alternative opportunities, liquidity.

- Probabilities allow for the possibility of luck in investment returns. It’s up to investors to assess past success — their’s and fund managers’ — to luck or skill. Hopefully, done so humbly and objectively.
- Poor returns might be due to a bad strategy, bad luck, or an out of favor strategy, soon to be in favor, thanks to mean reversion.

- Notes are based on the Illuminated edition.
- In investing, no rule works all the time. Markets are fluid systems, influenced by many variables, including the players involved in it. Change is constant. Surprises are inevitable. Unexpected things do happen.
- The best investment approach should be built on common sense and flexibility.
- Second Level Thinking:
  - To earn above-average returns, you not only must think differently and behave differently than everyone else, but you must be right more often than the consensus.
  - First-level thinkers rely on headlines and consensus opinions to make investment decisions.
  - Second-level thinkers weigh the possible outcomes, compare it against the consensus view, understand the consequences of being wrong, and the probability of being right.
  - First-level thinking is simplistic and binary.
  - Second-level thinking is complex and probabilistic.
  - Second-level thinkers often ask: "Who doesn’t know that?"

- Market Efficiency: markets are quick to incorporate new information into asset prices. However, it does not mean assets are priced accurately.
- More "efficient" assets tend to be: widely known, broadly followed, socially acceptable, and the information on it is widely available and comprehensible.
- More "inefficient" assets tend to be: little known or followed, taboo or controversial, and the information on it is limited and/or difficult to understand.
- Inefficiency is necessary to outperform the market, but won’t guarantee it.
- Assets prices are a product of consensus view. A contrarian view, and being right, is needed to recognize mispricing in markets. That, of course, is not easy given the same information and behavioral hurdles — including straying from the consensus — as everyone else.
- Chance — good or bad luck — plays a bigger role in short term investment outcomes. Skill plays a bigger role in the cumulative outcome over many, many decades.
- Intelligent investing is based on estimates of intrinsic value.
- Value investing looks for assets that can be valued based on fundamental factors like earnings or cash flows, which can be bought at a considerable discount to that value. Said another way, value investing looks to buy stocks with a current value significantly higher than its current price.
- The bigger the discount between price and value, the wider the margin of safety. A margin of safety brings added protection from unexpected events, being wrong, etc.
- Investing is a waiting game. In other words, waiting is a big part of any strategy, be it value, growth, etc. Perfectly timed stock purchases don’t happen without a lot of luck. Investors have no control over how quickly the market corrects a misalignment between value and price. Waiting is required.
- Waiting inevitably means investors are bound to look wrong often. But if the judgment of intrinsic value is correct, then it’s only temporary. That means being comfortable with losses. Fear of looking wrong, being uncomfortable with losses, is what gets investors into trouble.
A proper valuation, made with confidence, is the best defense against emotional decisions.

- A large margin of safety makes selling at the right price less important.
- Market prices are largely affected by psychology and technicals in the short term. Investors’ psychology can produce wild price swings in the short run. Understanding psychology is key to being able to take advantage of it. Controlling your own emotion is also key.
- Great opportunities arise when buying from forced sellers. That means don’t become a forced seller. - Build a strategy that avoids forced selling at any price.

- A "good" stock can produce losses if you overpay. A "bad" stock can produce gains when bought cheap. An "overpriced" stock can go higher. An "underpriced" stock can go lower. But eventually, valuation does matter.
- Roads to Investment Profits:
  - Increase Intrinsic Value: It’s difficult to predict. Often any potential increase is already priced in. To profit, the actual increase in value must exceed the market’s — the consensus — expectations.
  - Apply Leverage: A "good" investment doesn’t become a "great" investment with leverage. Leverage only magnifies gains and losses. It increases the risk of ruin.
  - Sell an Asset for More Than Its Worth: It requires a greater fool to come along and overpay for your asset.
  - Buy an Asset for Less Than Its Worth: One of the most reliable ways to profit…so long as you’re willing to wait. Even so, it’s not always guaranteed to work.
- Risk
  - Risk results from an unknowable future.
  - Avoiding or minimizing risk is a good thing.
  - Investment decisions should always consider the risk involved and potential return. Then determine if the return justifies the risk.
  - Riskier investments have a wider range of outcomes and more uncertainty around where the outcome falls. In other words, uncertainty means riskier investments can have high returns, low returns, or even a loss. And the probability distribution may be impossible to predict.
  - Risk = the possibility of permanent loss.
  - Other Types of Risk to Watch for:
    - Falling Short of Your Goals: investing is personal. It’s usually done with specific goals in mind like retirement, college education, etc. Not meeting those goals poses a risk.
    - Benchmark Risk: is an unwillingness to underperform a popular benchmark index, like the S&P 500, in the short term.
    - Career Risk: when a fund manager’s investment decisions are based more on keeping their job than the outcome of their funds.
    - Unconventionality: the risk of being different. Investing differently than the market often leads to returns that deviate from the market — not always in a good way. Being unconventional can get people fired or lead to market-beating returns.
    - Illiquidity: liquidity is the ability to turn assets into cash without sacrificing on price. The risk is not being able to do that when cash is needed most.
  - Risk is a function of price and value.
  - Risk of loss can be caused by strong or weak fundamentals depending on the price paid.
  - Risk of loss is possible under a strong or weak economic environment.
  - Risk is often an educated guess. It’s also difficult to measure in hindsight. Every investment has a range of outcomes. It’s impossible to measure risk knowing the outcome that did occur, without also knowing all the alternative outcomes.
  - Randomness and luck play a role in individual investment outcomes.
  - Most investors make decisions with the expectation that the future will mirror the past and underestimate change.
  - Worst-case projections are often based on what we know through history and fail to consider that something worse than what’s already happened, can happen.
  - Risk is uncertainty in the possibility that loss occurs out of all the possible outcomes.
  - High risk and low returns due to high prices are one and the same.
  - Risk tolerance, for the average investor, tends to move opposite of stock prices. As prices rise too high, investors become less risk-averse (more risk-tolerant) when they should be more risk-averse.
  - Many market bubbles were blown under the belief that something has no risk. Risk exists in every investment. The belief in no risk stems from widespread investor behavior that’s extremely optimistic and risk-averse. It’s a danger to watch out for. Risk is highest when the belief risk doesn’t exist is widespread.
  - Things to watch out for when risk is highest is excessive optimism, nonexistent skepticism, easy credit, strong capital inflows, low returns on "safe" investments,  recent high returns on typically "unsafe" investments, and a belief that those returns will stay high going forward.
  - In most cases, people are overconfident in their ability to see risk and avoid it.
  - The "Perversity of Risk" = "When investors feel risk is high, their actions serve to reduce risk. But when investors believe risk is low, they create dangerous conditions. The market is dynamic rather than static, and it behaves in ways that are counterintuitive."
  - Risk is often highest when the consensus believes it is lowest and vice versa. When the consensus believes an investment is risky and refuses to own it, their unwillingness likely reduces its price to a point where risk is lowest. The opposite is also true. When the consensus believes an investment is risk-free and everyone owns it, that enthusiastic demand has driven its price to a point where risk is highest.
  - The best investors earn asymmetrical returns to the risk they take. They often have a track record of avoiding disasters.
  - Risk management — risk control — is essential even when a potential risk isn’t obvious. It usually means forgoing some return to avoid any potential loss, even if the loss is never realized.
  - It’s important to remember that history is only a rough guide to what’s possible. Better and worse outcomes can occur. Outliers are possible that break entirely from historical norms.

- Economies, markets, and businesses rise and fall. It’s partially due to the involvement of people. Other factors are involved too but people reacting to those factors play a big role in the swings of cycles.
- Credit Cycle: "Prosperity brings expanded lending, which leads to unwise lending, which produces large losses, which makes lenders stop lending, which ends prosperity, and on and on."

- The mistake investors often make is believing a trend will continue, that a company will do well forever, and that the cycle is broken. Reversion is far more likely.

- Markets resemble a perpetual pendulum, swinging back and forth between two extremes. At one extreme are euphoria, greed, optimism, risk-tolerance, and overpriced assets. At the other are depression, fear, pessimism, risk-aversion, and underpriced assets. The pendulum never stops at the midpoint of its swing or the "average." It’s always swinging through it, towards one extreme or the other. It’s the swing of the pendulum that’s dependable. What’s less dependable — that keeps everyone guessing — is the rate, the speed, and power of the swing. We never know how far it swings, what causes it to reverse (or when or how quickly it reverses), and how far it swings back in the other direction.
- The primary risks in investing: Losing money and missed opportunities. It requires a balancing act for any portfolio (can’t eliminate both).
- 3 Stages of a Bull Market:
  - "The first, when a few forward-looking people begin to believe things will get better"
  - "The second, when most investors realize improvement is actually taking place"
  - "The third, when everyone concludes things will get better forever"
- 3 Stages of a Bear Market:
  - "The first, when just a few thoughtful investors recognize that, despite the prevailing bullishness, things won’t always be rosy"
  - "The second, when most investors recognize things are deteriorating"
  - "The third, when everyone’s convinced things can only get worse"

- Arbitraging human nature — exploited the common behavioral mistakes that lead to mispricing and inefficiencies in the market — can lead to above-average returns. Of course, it requires avoiding similar mistakes:
  - Greed – the pursuit of profits above all else, without consideration of risk.
  - Fear – prevents investors from making rational decisions and taking rational actions.
  - A Tendency to Dismiss Logic – when investors accept unlikely outcomes as probable because they would get rich quick.
  - Following the Herd – people, in general, are more comfortable following a group than going it alone…even when they know it’s the wrong decision.
  - Envy – people compare themselves to others too much…that includes returns. It makes it hard to watch others make more money in the stock market without eventually acting on it.
  - Ego – can lead to over-aggressive investing in the hopes of recognition, to show off high returns, or feel "smarter." It leads to short term thinking. Humility is needed to keep the ego in check.
  - Capitulation – the late behavior in all cycles is when the last holdouts give in and jump on the bandwagon.
  - Inadequate Skepticism – the recurring phrase "too good to be true" is repeated after every market bubble. A magically investment or strategy that produces high returns without risk doesn’t exist. A skeptic separates what’s too good to be true from what sounds good.
  - Fear of Being Wrong — when doubt pushes you to question your judgment on an investment because it declined in price (which is often the case when buying an underpriced asset) or you’re missing out on something that everyone else is making money on.
- All bubbles start with a grain of truth.
- Contrarianism means avoiding the repeated mistakes the herd makes at the extremes of the market cycle. The difficulty is in recognizing the extremes and then acting on it, knowing you’ll never time the bottom or top, or that prices can continue moving in the same direction longer than you might think.
- Outside of the extremes, contrarianism is less likely to be profitable.
- Experience might be the greatest teacher in recognizing the extremes of the market cycle.
- Investors must think in terms of probabilities when dealing with the future — what could happen and how likely is it to happen.

- Where to find bargains?
  - Something’s wrong — it looks bad on the surface like an over-leverage company, a failed project, or mismanagement.
  - Misunderstood asset — investors don’t look deep enough to understand it and/or show a bias towards it.
  - Highly unpopular – it’s ignored or scorned by the media, thus everyone else.
  - Controversial or inappropriate for most portfolios.
  - What’s being sold the most?
  - Of course, its price is falling — leading first-level thinkers to avoid it.

- A common mistake investors make is to equate action with adding value to a portfolio. Increased action usually just leads to overtrading and lower returns. Instead, investors should wait for the "best" opportunities to come to them — that they’re willing to act on — rather than chasing after things that add nominal value but carry more risk. This can be made worse by trying to create opportunities that don’t exist. Doing nothing is the hardest part of investing but often the most necessary.
- Knowing what you don’t know is essential to investing success.
- Accurately anticipating change is the most profitable but also the most difficult to predict.
- One aspect of knowing what you don’t know is being careful with your own forecasts and those of others because nobody knows the future with absolute certainty.
- The biggest mistake investors make is forgetting the limits of their own knowledge. This includes mistaking the difference between probability and outcome.

- If you know the future, it’s best to be aggressive, make concentrated bets, use leverage, time the market, and ignore risk — all the things great investors warn about. Because the greats don’t know the future, they are defensive, diversify, hedge, focus on value over price, emphasize risk management, and prepare for multiple outcomes.

- Rather than trying to figure out the future, try to figure out where we are in the market cycle, make adjustments if necessary when close to the extremes, and prepare mentally to avoid behavioral mistakes that plague investors throughout. The key is to watch for investor behavior that typically emerges, especially at the extremes of the cycle.
- Randomness or luck plays a bigger role in investing than most people want to admit. It’s how someone can bet on a long-shot lottery stock, win big, and look like a genius. But it has little to do with skill and a lot to do with luck. In the short run, any outcome is possible including the least probable. In the long run, bet hundreds or thousands of times, the total outcomes will approach what’s most probable.
- Investors’ decisions should be judged independent of the outcome because randomness allows for investors to make the wrong decision and still make money (or the right decision and lose). Process over outcomes is what matters.

- A good investment strategy essentially has a dial that can adjust the balance between "making money" and "avoiding losses." Of course, turning the dial requires rational thinking.
- The offensive investor is usually focused on aggressive investments/positions in order to outperform.
- The defensive investor is usually focused on avoiding mistakes and not doing the wrong thing that leads to losses. For defensive investors, that means avoiding investments that have a high probability of losses and avoiding overexposure to big drawdowns in a crash.

- A large margin of safety increases a portfolio’s tolerance for undesirable outcomes. A lower price — in relation to value — is the primary source of this margin. The lower the price, the wider the margin.

- With stocks, the upside isn’t fixed like bonds. So the investor must find a balance between offense and defense. Obviously, they must play defense to avoid the losers, but must also play offense for the higher return.
- Failure of Imagination – Marks defines it as the inability to come up with a full range of outcomes and/or not completely understanding the consequences of those outcomes. Specifically, it’s in reference to extreme outliers.
- Avoiding big losses means building a portfolio to protect from the possibility of unlikely terrible losses occurring.
- On asset correlation: "The failure to correctly anticipate co-movement within a portfolio is a critical source of investment error."

- george soros and reflexitity:
  - "financial markets, far from accurately reflecting all the available knowledge, always provide a distorted view of reality. This is the principle of fallibility. The degree of distortion may vary from time to time. Sometimes, it's quite insignificant, at other times, it is quite pronounced.
  - "Every bubble has 2 components: an underlying trend that prevails in reality and a misconception relating to that trend. When a positive feedback develops between the trend and the misconception, a boom-bust process is set in motion. The process is liable to be tested by negative feedback along the way, and if it is strong enough to survive these tests, both the trend and the misconception will be reinforced."

- Lessons from a Crisis:
  - Too much capital availability makes money flow to the wrong places.
  - When capital goes where it shouldn’t, bad things happen.
  - When capital is in oversupply, investors compete for deals by accepting low returns and a slender margin for error.
  - Widespread disregard for risk creates great risk.
  - Inadequate due diligence leads to investment losses.
  - In heady times, capital is devoted to innovative investments, many of which fail the test of time.
  - Hidden fault lines running through portfolios can make the prices of seemingly unrelated assets move in tandem.
  - Psychological and technical factors can swamp fundamentals.
  - Markets change, invalidating models.
  - Leverage magnifies outcomes but doesn’t add value.
  - Excesses correct.

- The biggest mistake investors make is selling at the bottom and missing the recovery.

- Any expectation of investment returns should be reasonable.

- Every investor should have a return goal in mind, know the amount of risk they can tolerate, and the amount of liquidity their strategy requires.


# Quotes

“Disregarding for the moment whether the prevailing level of stock prices on January 1, 1987 was logical, we are certain that the value of American industry in the aggregate had not increased by 44% as of August 25. Similarly, it is highly unlikely that the value of American industry declined by 23% on a single day, October 19.” — Ruane and Cunniff on 1987.

“Since security prices reflect investors’ perception of reality and not necessarily reality itself, overvaluation may persist for a long time.”

“In investing it is never wrong to change your mind. It is only wrong to change your mind and do nothing about it.”

“The trick of successful investors is to sell when they want to, not when they have to.”

“The essential point is that security analysis does not seek to determine exactly what is the intrinsic value of a given security. It needs only to establish that the value is adequate – e.g., to protect a bond or to justify a stock purchase – or else that the value is considerably higher or considerably lower than the market price. For such purposes an indefinite and approximate measure of the intrinsic value may be sufficient.” — Ben Graham

“Any attempt to value businesses with precision will yield values that are precisely inaccurate. The problem is that it is easy to confuse the capability to make precise forecasts with the ability to make accurate ones.”

“Small changes in either revenues or expenses cause far greater percentage changes in profits. The number of things that can go wrong greatly exceeds the number that can go right.”

“As with any value investment, the greater the undervaluation, the greater the margin of safety to investors.”

“A simple rule applies: if you don’t quickly comprehend what a company is doing, then management probably doesn’t either.”

“…the herd mentality of investors can cause all companies in an out-of-favor industry, however disparate, to be tarred with the same brush.”

“In an illiquid market the price at which a security transaction takes place is determined not so much by investment fundamentals as by the trading savvy of the participants. In the illiquid market for distressed and bankrupt bonds, being a smart trader may sometimes be more important than being a smart analyst.”

“All investors must come to terms with the relentless continuity of the investment process. Although specific investments have a beginning and an end, portfolio management goes on forever.”

“Since no investor is infallible and no investment is perfect, there is considerable merit in being able to change one’s mind.”

“In the stock market, there is liquidity for the individual but not for the whole community. The distributable profits of a company are the only rewards for the community.” — Louis Lowenstein, What’s Wrong with Wall Street

“Diversification, after all, is not how many different things you own, but how different the things you do own are in the risks they entail.”

“The best investment opportunities arise when other investors act unwisely thereby creating rewards for those who act intelligently.”

“There is only one valid rule for selling: all investments are for sale at the right price.”

“Returns must always be examined in the context of risk.”

"When there’s nothing particularly clever to do, the potential pitfall lies in insisting on being clever."

"Asymmetry—better performance on the upside than on the downside relative to what your style alone would produce—should be every investor’s goal."

"Perfection in investing is generally unobtainable; the best we can hope for is to make a lot of good investments and exclude most of the bad ones."

"Most of these eleven lessons can be reduced to just one: be alert to what’s going on around you with regard to the supply/demand balance for investable funds and the eagerness to spend them."

"…we always think in terms of earnings yield (which is just the inverse of the P/E) rather than in P/Es; doing so allows for easy comparison to fixed-income alternatives." — Christopher Davis

"Short-run outcomes can diverge from the long-run probabilities, and occurrences can cluster."

"One way to maximize the asymmetry of risk and reward is to make sure you minimize risk. I’ve said this before in another place: if you minimize the chance of loss in an investment, most of the other alternatives are good." — Joel Greenblatt

"Investing scared, requiring good value and a substantial margin for error, and being conscious of what you don’t know and can’t control are hallmarks of the best investors I know."

"An investor needs to do very few things right as long as he avoids big mistakes." — Warren Buffett


"In fixed income…returns are limited and the manager’s greatest contribution comes through the avoidance of loss. Because the upside is truly "fixed," the only variability is on the downside, and avoiding it holds the key. Thus, distinguishing yourself as a bond investor isn’t a matter of which paying bonds you hold, but largely of whether you’re able to exclude bonds that don’t pay. According to Graham and Dodd, this emphasis on exclusion makes fixed income investing a negative art."

"Here is part of the tradeoff with diversification. You must be diversified enough to survive bad times or bad luck so that skill and good process can have the chance to pay off over the long term." — Joel Greenblatt

"For good investors, as the time horizon expands, which allows skill to come into play, the probability distribution of long-term returns should narrow." — Joel Greenblatt

"Overestimating what you’re capable of knowing or doing can be extremely dangerous—in brain surgery, transocean racing or investing. Acknowledging the boundaries of what you can know—and working within those limits rather than venturing beyond—can give you a great advantage."

"It’s frightening to think that you might not know something, but more frightening to think that, by and large, the world is run by people who have faith that they know exactly what’s going on." — Amos Tversky

"Some of the biggest losses occur when overconfidence regarding predictive ability causes investors to underestimate the range of possibilities, the difficulty of predicting which one will materialize, and the consequences of a surprise."

"Good times teach only bad lessons: that investing is easy, that you know its secrets, and that you needn’t worry about risk. The most valuable lessons are learned in tough times."

"Beating the market matters, but limiting risk matters just as much. Ultimately, investors have to ask themselves whether they are interested in relative or absolute returns. Losing 45 percent while the market drops 50 percent qualifies as market outperformance, but what a pyrrhic victory this would be for most of us." — Seth Klarman

"First-level thinking says, "I think the company’s earnings will fall; sell."

"Second-level thinking says, "I think the company’s earnings will fall less than people expect, and the pleasant surprise will lift the stock; buy.""

"The idea is that agreeing with the broad consensus, while a very comfortable place for most people to be, is not generally where above-average profits are found." — Joel Greenblatt

"Psychological influences are a dominating factor governing investor behavior. They matter as much as—and at times more than—underlying value in determining securities prices." — Seth Klarman

"Human beings are not clinical computing machines. Rather, most people are driven by greed, fear, envy, and other emotions that render objectivity impossible and open the door for significant mistakes."

"Many of the best bargains at any point in time are found among the things other investors can’t or won’t do."

"Let others believe markets can never be beat. Abstention on the part of those who won’t venture in creates opportunities for those who will."

"Warren Buffett says that the best investment course would teach just two things well: How to value an investment and how to think about market price movements." — Joel Greenblatt

"It’s hard to consistently do the right thing as an investor. But it’s impossible to consistently do the right thing at the right time. The most we value investors can hope for is to be right about an asset’s value and buy when it’s available for less."

"Unless you buy at the exact bottom tick (which is next to impossible), you will be down at some point after you make every investment." — Joel Greenblatt

 "There are two essential ingredients for profit in a declining market: you have to have a view on intrinsic value, and you have to hold that view strongly enough to be able to hang in and buy even as price declines suggest that you’re wrong. Oh yes, there’s a third: you have to be right."

"Investment success doesn’t come from "buying good things," but rather from "buying things well.""

"It has been demonstrated time and time again that no asset is so good that it can’t become a bad investment if bought at too high a price. And there are few assets so bad that they can’t be a good investment when bought cheap enough."

"There’s no such thing as a good or bad idea regardless of price!"

"Investing is a popularity contest, and the most dangerous thing is to buy something at the peak of its popularity. At that point, all favorable facts and opinions are already factored into its price, and no new buyers are left to emerge."

"Risk means more things can happen than will happen." — Elroy Dimson

"The most dangerous investment conditions generally stem from psychology that’s too positive. For this reason, fundamentals don’t have to deteriorate in order for losses to occur; a downgrading of investor opinion will suffice. High prices often collapse of their own weight."

"...the relation between different kinds of investments and the risk of loss is entirely too indefinite, and too variable with changing conditions, to permit of sound mathematical formulation." — Security Analysis, Graham and Dodd

"Some of the greatest losses arise when investors ignore the improbable possibilities."

"There’s a big difference between probability and outcome. Probable things fail to happen—and improbable things happen—all the time." — Bruce Newberg

"Unusual and unlikely things can happen, and outcomes can occur in runs (and go to extremes) that are hard to predict. Underestimating uncertainty and its consequences is a big contributor to investor difficulty."

"The received wisdom is that risk increases in the recessions and falls in booms. In contrast, it may be more helpful to think of risk as increasing during upswings, as financial imbalances build up, and materializing in recessions." — Andrew Crockett

"Risk cannot be eliminated; it just gets transferred and spread."

"The road to long-term investment success runs through risk control more than through aggressiveness. Over a full career, most investors’ results will be determined more by how many losers they have, and how bad they are, than by the greatness of their winners. Skillful risk control is the mark of the superior investor."

"Rule number one: most things will prove to be cyclical. Rule number two: some of the greatest opportunities for gain and loss come when other people forget rule number one."

"Understanding that cycles are eventually self-correcting is one way to maintain some optimism when bargain hunting after large market drops." — Joel Greenblatt

"When things are going well, extrapolation introduces great risk. Whether it’s company profitability, capital availability, price gains, or market liquidity, things that inevitably are bound to regress toward the mean are often counted on to improve forever."

"Stocks are cheapest when everything looks grim."

"The desire for more, the fear of missing out, the tendency to compare against others, the influence of the crowd and the dream of the sure thing—-these factors are near universal. Thus they have a profound collective impact on most investors and most markets. The result is mistakes, and those mistakes are frequent, widespread and recurring."

"Nothing is easier than self-deceit. For what each man wishes, that he also believes to be true." — Demosthenes

The biggest investing errors come not from factors that are informational or analytical, but from those that are psychological.

"Many of the mistakes I have made are the same ones that I had made before; they just look a little different each time—the same mistake slightly disguised." — Joel Greenblatt

"Rising prices are a narcotic that affects the reasoning power up and down the line." — Warren Buffett

"The tendency to compare results is one of the most invidious. The emphasis on relative returns over absolute returns shows how psychology can distort the process."

"In my view, the road to investment success is usually marked by humility, not ego."

"To buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are euphorically buying takes the greatest courage, but provides the greatest profit." — John Templeton

"Investment success requires sticking with positions made uncomfortable by their variance with popular opinion." — David Swensen

"Most people seem to think outstanding performance to date presages outstanding future performance. Actually, it’s more likely that outstanding performance to date has borrowed from the future and thus presages subpar performance from here on out."

"There are two primary elements in superior investing: seeing some quality that others don’t see or appreciate (and that isn’t reflected in the price), and having it turn out to be true (or at least accepted by the market)."

"Investment is the discipline of relative selection." — Sid Cottle

"Our goal isn’t to find good assets, but good buys. Thus, it’s not what you buy; it’s what you pay for it."

"Investment bargains needn’t have anything to do with high quality. In fact, things tend to be cheaper if low quality has scared people away."

"The market’s not a very accommodating machine; it won’t provide high returns just because you need them." — Peter Bernstein

"Patient opportunism—waiting for bargains—is often your best strategy."
