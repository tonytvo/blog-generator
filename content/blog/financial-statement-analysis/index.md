# Warren Buffett and the interpretation of financial statements
- 3 ways that corporations can use financial reporting to enhance their value are:
  - reduce their cost of capital
  - improve their credit ratings
  - increase their price-earnings multiple
- "every debit must have a credit", double entry system.
- a well managed and profitable business will show a strong flow of cash through the plumbing of accounts from net income to growing/decreasing equity and/or dividend.
- cash based accounting:
  - transaction are recorded on the basis of inflow and outflow of cash when the money actually changes accounts, not when the service or product is provided or received.
  - useful for small businesses that operate on a cash basis, such as "mom and pop" style businesses.
  - it's not a good fit for large business due to it is slow and delayed in tracking revenues and expenses.
- accrual accounting:
  - expenditures must be recorded when incurred and not when paid. Similarly, revenue must be recorded when there is an outflow of services or goods.
  - it provides a clearer and realistic picture of the company's performance, however, cashflow statement analysis would be required to account for any inconsistencies caused from accrual accounting.

## D.C.A. and income statement summary

- **gross profit margin**
  - Firms with excellent long term economics tend to have consistently higher margins
  - Durable competitive advantage creates  a high margin because of the freedom to price in excess of cost
    - Greater than 40% = Durable competitive advantage
    - Less than 40% = competition eroding margins
    - Less than 20% = no sustainable competitive advantage
  - Consistency is key
- **Sales Goods and Administration**
  - Companies with no durable competitive advantage show wild variation in SG&A as % of gross profit
    - Less than 30% is fantastic
    - Nearing 100% is in highly competitive industry
  - Consistency is key
- **R&D**
  - If competitive advantage is created by a patent or tech advantage, at some point it will disappear.
  - High R&D usually dictates high SG&A which threatens the competitive advantage
- **depreciation**
  - Companies with durable competitive advantages tend to have lower depreciation costs as a % of gross profit
- **interest expenses**
  - Companies with high interest expenses relative to operating income tend to be either:
    - in a fiercely competitive industry where large capital expenditure required to stay competitive
    - a company with excellent business economics that acquired debt in leveraged buyout
      - Companies with durable competitive advantages often carry little or no interest expense.
      - Warren’s favorites in the consumer products category all have less than 15% of operating income.
      - Interest expenses varies widely between industries.
      - Interest ratios can be very informative of level of economic danger.
  - **In any industry, the company with the lowest ratio of interest to Operating Income is usually the one with the competitive advantage.**
- **net earnings**
  - Look for consistency and upward long term trend.
  - Because of share repurchase it is possible for net earnings trend to differ from EPS trend.
  - Preferred over EPS
  - Durable competitive advantage companies report higher % net earnings to total revenues.
  - If net earnings is less than 10%, likely to be in a highly competitive business
  - **If a company is showing net earnings history greater than 20% on total revenues, it is probably benefiting from a long term competitive advantage.**
- **EPS**
  - 10-year period showing consistency and upward trend.
    - it maybe an indicator that products don’t need to change.

## D.C.A. and balance sheet summary

- **cash and equivalents**
  - A high number means either:
    - 1) The company has competitive advantage generating lots of cash
    - 2) Just sold a business or bonds (not necessarily good)
  - A low stockpile of cash usually means poor to mediocre economics.
  - There are 3 ways to create large cash reserve.
    - 1) Sell new bonds or equity to public
    - 2) Sell business or asset
    - 3) It has an ongoing business generating more cash than it burns (usually means durable competitive advantage)
  - When a company is suffering a short term problem, Buffett looks at **cash + marketable securities + little debt to see whether it has the financial strength to ride it out**.
  - Test to see what is creating cash by looking at past 7 yrs of balance sheets. This will reveal how the cash was created.
- **inventory**
  - Manufacturers with durable competitive advantages have the advantage that the products they sell do not change, and therefore will never become obsolete. Buffett likes this advantage.
  - When identifying manufacturers with durable competitive advantage, look for inventory and net earnings that rise correspondingly. This indicates that the company is finding profitable ways to increase sales which called for an increase in inventory.
  - Manufacturers with inventories that spike up and down are indicative of competitive industries subject to boom and bust.
- **Net Receivables**
  - Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.
  - If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging
- **Property, Plant & Equipment**
  - A company with durable competitive advantage doesn’t need to constantly upgrade its equipment to stay competitive. The company replaces when it wears out. On the other hand, a company without any advantages must replace to keep pace.
  - Difference between a company with a moat and one without is that the company with the competitive advantage finances new equipment through internal cash flows, whereas the no advantage company requires debt to finance.
  - Producing a consistent product that doesn’t change equates to consistent profits. There is no need to upgrade plants which frees up cash for other ventures. Think Coca Cola, Johnson & Johnson etc.
- **goodwill**
  - Whenever you see an increase in goodwill over a number of years, you can assume it’s because the company is out buying other businesses above book value. GOOD if buying businesses with durable competitive advantage.
  - If goodwill stays the same, the company when acquiring other companies is either paying less than book value or not acquiring. Businesses with moats never sell for less than book value.

- **Intangible Assets**
  - Intangibles acquired are on balance sheet at fair value.
  - Internally developed brand names (Coke, Wrigleys, Band-Aid) however are not reflected on the balance sheet.
  - One of the reasons competitive advantage power can remain hidden for so long
- **Total Assets & Return on Total Assets**
  - Measure efficiency using ROA
  - Capital is barrier to entry. One of things that make a competitive advantage durable is the cost of assets needed to get in. This is why we calculate the [Asset Reproduction Value](https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/how-to-asset-reproduction-value-analysis/) along with the [EPV](https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/book-reviews/greenwald-earnings-power-value-investing-epv/).
  - Many analysts argue the higher return the better. Buffett states that really high ROA may indicate vulnerability in the durability of the competitive advantage.
  - E.g. Raising $43b to take on KO is impossible, but $1.7b to take on Moody’s is. Although Moody’s ROA and underlying economics is far superior to Coca Cola, the durability is far weaker because of lower entry cost.
- **Current Liabilities**
  - Includes accounts payable, accrued expenses, other current liabilities and short term debt.
  - Stay away from companies that ‘roll over the debt’ e.g. Bear Stearns
  - When investing in financial institutions, Buffett shies from those who are bigger borrowers of short term than long term debt.
    - His favorite ‘Wells Fargo’ has 57 cents short term debt for every dollar of long term
    - Aggressive banks (like Bank of America) has $2.09 short term for every dollar long term
  - Durability equates to the stability of being conservative.

- **Long Term Debt coming Due**
  - Some companies lump their yearly long term debt due with short term debt on the balance sheet. This makes it seem like there is more short term debt than the real amount.

  - **Important: Companies with durable comparable advantages need little or no LT debt to maintain operations.**

  - Too much debt coming due in a single year spooks investors and can offer attractive entry points.

  - However, a mediocre company in problems with too much debt due leads to cash flow problems and certain bankruptcy.
- **long term debt**
  - Buffett says that durable competitive advantages carry little to no LT debt because the company is so profitable that even expansions or acquisitions are self financed.

  - We are interested in long term debt load for the last ten years. If the ten yrs of operation show little to no long term debt, then the company has some kind of strong competitive advantage.

  - Buffett’s historic purchases indicate that on any given year, the company should have sufficient yearly net earnings to pay all long term within 3 or 4 year earnings period. (e.g. Coke + Moody’s = 1yr)

  - Companies with enough earning power to pay long term debt in less than 3 or 4 years is a good candidate in our search for long term competitive advantage.

  - BUT, these companies are targets for leveraged buy outs, which saddles the business with long term debt
  - If all else indicates the company has a moat, but it has ton of debt, a leveraged buyout may have created the debt. In these cases the company’s bonds offer the better bet, in that the company’s earnings power is focused on paying off the debt and not growth.
  - **Important: little or no long term debt often means a Good Long Term Bet**

- **Total Liabilities & Debt to Shareholders Equity Ratio**
  - Debt to shareholders equity ratio helps identify whether the company uses debt or equity (includes retained earnings) to finance operations.
  - Company with a moat uses earning power and should show higher levels of equity and lower level of liabilities.
  - Debt to Shareholders Equity Ratio : Total Liabilities / Shareholders Equity
  - Problem with using as identifier is that economics of companies with durable competitive advantages are so great they don’t need large amount of equity or retained earnings on the balance sheet to get the job done.
  - **if the Treasury Share Adjusted Debt to Shareholder Equity Ratio is less than 0.8, the company has a durable competitive advantage.**

- **Retained Earning**:
  - One of the most important indicators of durable competitive advantage. Net earnings can be paid out as dividends, used to buy back shares or retained for growth.
  - If the company loses more than it has accumulated, retained earnings is negative.

  - If a company isn’t adding to its retained earnings, it isn’t growing its net worth.
  - Rate of growth of retained earnings is good indicator whether it’s benefiting from a competitive advantage.
  - Microsoft is negative because it chose to buyback stock and pay dividends
  - The more earnings retained, the faster it grows and increases growth rate for future earnings.
- **treasury stock**
  - Carried on the balance sheet as a negative value because it represents a reduction in shareholders equity.
  - Companies with moats have free cash, so treasury shares are hallmark of durable competitive advantages.
  - When shares are bought back and held as treasury stock, it is effectively decreasing the company equity. This increases return on shareholders equity.
  - High return is a sign of competitive advantage. It’s good to know if it’s generated by financial engineering or exceptional business economics or combination.
  - To see which is which, convert negative value of treasury shares into a positive and add it to shareholders equity. Then divide net earnings by new shareholders equity. This will give the return on equity minus effects of window dressing.
  - presence of treasury shares and a history of buyback are good indicators that company has competitive advantage
- **preferred + common stock**
  - in search for D.C.A. we look for absence of preferred stock
- **Return on Shareholder equity**
  - d.c.a. show higher than average returns on shareholders equity
  - If company shows history of strong net earnings, but shows –ve shoulder equity, probably d.c.a. because strong companies don’t need to retain
  

## D.C.A. and cash flow statement summary

- **Capital Expenditures**
  - Never invest in telephone companies because of big capital outlays
  - Important: company with durable competitive advantage uses a smaller portion of earnings for capital expenditure for continuing operations than those without.

  - To compare capex to net earnings, add up total capex for ten-yr period and compare with total net earnings over the same period

  - Important: **if historically using less than 50%, then good place to look for durable competitive advantage. If less than 25%, probably has a competitive advantage**

- **stock buybacks**
  - indicator of d.c.a. is a history of repurchasing/retiring its shares
  - Look at cash from investment activities. “Issuance (Retirement) of Stock, Net"

# financial shenanigans
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg-led5YMlo&ab_channel=TheSwedishInvestor
- Some financial manipulations, or shenanigans, are benign and may not hurt anyone.
- Shenanigans that inflate profits are of greatest concern, followed by those that hide expenses or shift revenue from one time period to another.
- Not all financial shenanigans are illegal, nor do they necessarily violate generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
- Quarterly financial reports are not independently audited, however it is highly unlikely a company will be caught manipulating unaudited reports.
- Only a small fraction of companies fraudulently distort their financial reports.
- Rapidly growing firms that suddenly face a slow down may be tempted to cheat.
- Reporting bogus revenue can destroy a company’s reputation.
- A CEO fixated on making “the numbers” at any cost is an investor’s nightmare.
- Internal auditors should report directly to the Board of Directors’ audit committee.
- The SEC should have authority to bar or suspend corporate executives and board members who become involved in fraudulent financial reporting.
- **when to be on the look out**:
  - If a company operates in a weak oversight environment, with a closely held board of directors or without a competent independent auditor, you have reason for concern. 
  - If management faces an inordinate degree of competitive pressure, that should draw your attention. 
  - If executives are known, for whatever reason, to be of dubious character or integrity, you have reason to wonder if that lack of integrity has crept over into other areas of the company’s business. 
  - If any of these indicators takes place in a previously high-flying company where growth is now starting to slow, be especially wary and on the lookout. 
  - Also be cautious about inner doings at basket-case companies that are struggling just to stay alive.
- **audit your auditor**
  - The auditors spend weeks reviewing the financial records of a company, so spend some time reading their opinions. The opinion letter will usually give a clean view, that is, it will give the report a stamp of approval. If the auditors have a serious reservation about the accuracy and fairness of a company’s financial statement, however, they will usually qualify the report. A company that receives a qualified opinion should raise the hackles on an investor’s back - especially if the qualification notes any "going concern."
  - Also look out for a situation where no audit committee exists, or the audit committee is comprised of less-than-independent members. The purpose of the audit committee is to act as a go-between, mediating between the outside auditor and the executives. Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange are required to have audit committees. No similar requirement binds most other publicly traded companies.
- **catching the crooks**
  - So how do you find out when a company is scamming you? Screening the veracity of financial reports is easier now, thanks to several Internet databases that equip you to check for signs of malfeasance. Some sites focus more on the numbers, others help you investigate a company’s footnotes, management discussions and news releases. The most widely used commercial database is Compustat, which is a product that is sold by Standard & Poor’s, a division of McGraw-Hill. Another database is sold by Factset Corporation
  - With these tools, you can run a filter for companies showing the sharpest decline in operational cash flow, as a percentage of net income. Or you can list companies that experienced the largest year-to-year sales growth followed by declining or negative growth. You can also seek the biggest increase in inventory, compared to sales. Other things you can look for include a very large deterioration in gross margins, a big jump in soft assets or a large increase in deferred revenue
- **buying trouble**
  - Acquisitions are fertile ground for chicanery. Many companies seek to buy other companies in order to rapidly accelerate their own growth, a strategy with many risks for investors. Several tricks that relate to acquisitions can be used to help cover up the underlying ill health of the purchasing company. These gimmicks include taking large write-offs before or after the acquisition, shifting loses from the deal to another time period and releasing the reserves that may be created through large write-offs. Be concerned when a firm uses very aggressive acquisition behavior in a way that might make its sales look better than they really are
- **the lessons of enron**
  - One of the lessons of Enron is to be wary when a company makes a drastic change in how it does business. This is especially the case when a company is making a transition from an easily understood model, such as acquiring gas pipelines, to a model that is far more difficult to assess, such as trading on future energy contracts. Other warning signs included the use of special-purpose entities (SPEs), that is, off the books facilities that could be used to hide either profits or liabilities. Red flags should have been flapping because Enron did not provide detailed disclosure about the purpose of the SPEs

## telling tall tales

- Accounting’s two fraudulent strategies are to either inflate or deflate earnings. 
  - The first can be accomplished by reporting an unduly large current period revenue, or by underestimating current period expenses. Manipulating either side of the ledger will work. 
  - The second, less intuitive strategy involves deflating or underestimating earnings. Why would anyone want to do that? Well, if you underestimate your financial performance, you can shift earnings to a later timeframe when you need them to cover shortfalls. Essentially you minimize current profits in order to inflate future profits, thereby making the company appear to perform better than it actually does
- Companies manipulate financial statements for three reasons:
  - **It is easy** – After all, managers themselves check a variety of options to select the accounting methods their firms will use. Managers with integrity review the options available to find a reporting method that most closely reflects the company’s performance. Unscrupulous executives, however, see the choices as an opportunity to take advantage of the system. Management is free to structure transactions or to announce reporting moves to promote the achievement of its accounting goals. For example, when using an operating lease approach, they can use lease agreements to keep debt off the books.
  - **It can pay off handsomely** – Bonuses are often tied to a company’s financial profiles, so managers have a vested interest.
  - **The chances of getting caught are slim** – Those who think they’ll get away with it are often right. For instance, a company’s quarterly financial statements are unaudited and, usually, are not reviewed by an independent CPA. When an unaudited financial report is manipulated, it is highly unlikely that the company will be caught.
- When you evaluate the validity of a company’s reporting, be aware of any misguided management incentives. These are not at all uncommon. Basing bonuses and stock options heavily on financial statement measurements create a temptation to cheat. Too much emphasis on the bottom line can cause observers to question the validity of a firm’s numbers.

## the seven financial shenanigans
- The Center for Financial Research and Analysis (CFRA) has defined 30 techniques, grouped into seven categories, that represent the ways that unethical companies dupe investors
  - **Recording bogus revenue** – This is the cardinal sin of accounting, and it can be accomplished in more ways than you might think. For example, some sales may appear to be significant, but they lack actual economic substance. Cash received in lending transactions can be recorded cleverly as revenue. Similarly, a company may try to record investment income as operating revenue. Another nasty trick is to count as revenue the rebates from suppliers that the company will receive on future purchases. And, finally, a company may release revenue that it improperly held back in the first place, perhaps prior to a merger.
  - **Recording poor-quality revenue** – All revenue is not equal. Revenue for services that have not yet been provided, for example, is poor revenue and shouldn’t be counted. Revenue should never be recorded before the item being sold has actually shipped and been accepted by the customer. A company should not record revenue if the customer isn’t required to pay. Sales to an affiliated company are also dubious. Grossing up revenue is another way to "cook the books."
  - **One-time gains** – Occasionally a company will sell assets or make an investment windfall, and count that as revenue. The problem is that this is really only a one-time gain. Similarly, a one-time gain can be used to make operating expenses appear less than they really are. Another dirty little trick is reclassifying accounts on the balance sheet in a way that creates apparent income.
  - **Failing to report future liabilities accurately** – One way a company can put lipstick on the pig is to fail to record an obligation, or otherwise move to reduce the list of liabilities improperly. Of course, owing less money makes a company look more profitable. This can be achieved by changing accounting assumptions, allowing reserves to be suddenly counted as income or creating phony rebates.
  - **Expense-shifting** – If you can stretch current expenses out so that they actually fall into a later reporting period, the results will appear to be better than they actually are. This includes reducing reserves, failing to write off impaired assets or taking too long to amortize expenses. Or, you could simply change accounting policies.
  - **Income-shifting** – Manipulation can also occur by way of shifting current revenue to a later period. This is sometimes achieved by creating a reserve account, and then eliminating it later on when the money is needed. Also be aware that companies occasionally hold back income before an acquisition deal closes.
  - **Special charges** – Even more subtle is the business of shifting future costs to the current period, as a special charge. Inflating the amount of a special charge, writing off R & D costs related to an acquisition and accelerating discretionary expenses are a few of the tricks of the trade.

## fighting shenanigans

- So what can be done to make sure there is no recurrence of Enron? Many parties must be involved in changing the way things work. Those who determine and interpret laws, and set professionals standards must establish clear parameters on proper financial accounting and reporting standards. Internal auditors should report directly to the audit committees of their boards

- The Securities and Exchange Commission, set up after the stock market crash of 1929 to supervise the nature and accuracy of information provided to investors, should be given explicit legal authority to suspend or bar any corporate executive, director or board involved in financial misdealings. Management must set the proper tone and cannot emphasize reaching its numbers above everything else. Companies should be required to have auditors review their quarterly financial statements before they are released to the public. Auditors should be held more accountable for detecting fraud during an audit.
- In 1995, the SEC, the NASD and the NYSE combined forces to commission a study recommending ways to strengthen the audit committee function. The blue-ribbon panel determined that boards of directors have to engage in active, independent oversight. The notion that a seat on a board is a reward for having "made it" in business should be replaced by an active responsibility to guide the company forward. The audit committee has to be the main body that is responsible for driving the acceptance of proper accounting practices within the organization.
- Perhaps financial shenanigans can never be completely eliminated. But certain steps can and must be taken to restore corporate credibility. Auditor training should place greater emphasis on the ability to detect accounting tricks and manipulations. Training should also be improved for those who rely on financial reports, including investors. The incentives to manipulate the numbers that are built into executive compensation packages should be re-evaluated. Investors, auditors and regulators have a much better chance of minimizing the damage that corporate dishonesty causes once they gain a better understanding of how dishonest companies pull off financial shenanigans.
# Quotes

If you're analyzing an unstable business, then your analysis might be worthless

A good rule of thumb is to limit the cost of your transaction to no more than 1 percent of the amount of stock you’re buying. For example if a trade costs $9.99 to execute you should buy at least $1,000 worth of stock.

Trying to beat the market is a fool’s errand.

We want the business to be one (a) that we understand; (b) with favorable long-term prospects; (c) operated by honest and competent people; (d) available at a very attractive price.

price is what you pay, value is what you get

once you adopt a value-investment strategy, any other investment behavior starts to seem like gambling.

the key to life is to figure out who to be the batboy for.

accounting is the language of business

"Financial shenanigans are actions that intentionally distort a company’s reported financial performance and financial condition. They range from benign (changes in accounting estimates) to egregious (fraudulent recognition of bogus revenue)."

"In general, shenanigans that inflate revenue should be considered more serious than those that affect expenses."

"A compensation structure that heavily emphasizes the bottom line creates an environment that sometimes encourages accounting chicanery."

"...management may have little difficulty distorting financial reports if the company has weak internal controls."

"When companies face troubled times because of business slowdowns and other setbacks, their managers frequently take certain (bookkeeping) steps to ensure that the sun will come out tomorrow."

"Special charges offer a wonderful opportunity to artificially boost future operating profits."

"Despite the efforts of rule makers, internal and independent auditors, regulators and others working in harmony to prevent, detect and eliminate financial shenanigans, the problem continues to exist and is not likely to disappear any time soon."

"Investors should be wary whenever a company dramatically changes its business model, particularly from one easily understood by investors to another, far more obtuse and difficult to evaluate and monitor."
