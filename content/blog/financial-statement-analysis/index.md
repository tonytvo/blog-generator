# interpretation of financial statements
- [interpretation of financial statements by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett](/interpretation-of-financial-statements/)
- tracking how the money flows through a business is like watching a plumber determine where the leak is in a house. He starts at the source, where the water enters the main valve into the house (the net income), and he ends at the sink (the growing/decreasing equity and/or dividend). A well-managed profitable business will show a strong flow of cash through the plumbing of the accounts.
- the accounting system is based on double entries. For every debit, there must be a credit.
- **cash-based accounting**
  - transaction is recorded only when cash is physically or digitally received into the bank account, not when the service or product is provided or received.
  - this might be alright for "mom and pop"-style businesses, accounting laws do not allow for larger companies to conduct cash-based accounting. The reason for this is because it represents a low and delayed way of tracking revenues and expenses.
- **accrual accounting**
  - accrual accounting simply states that expenditures must be recorded when incurred and not when paid. Similarly, revenue must recorded when there is an outflow of services or goods, not when the payment is realized.
  - publicly traded companies are based on accrual accounting.
  - although accrual accounting might count funds that haven't actually been paid, it provides a clearer and realistic picture of the company's performance - especially for stock investors. A great way to account for any inconsistencies caused from accrual accounting is by thoroughly understanding the cash flow statement.

# Income statement analysis
- [income statement analysis](https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/income-statement-analysis-walkthrough/)
- [old school value durable competitive advantage financial statement analysis](./durable-competitive-financial-statements-analysis.xlsx)
- the income statement's sole purpose is to show a company's profitability over a given period of time.

- **revenues from primary activities**
  - it's revenue received for the sale of company's primary product or service
- **revenues from secondary activities**
  - such as interests from cash sitting in an interest-bearing savings account produce revenue
  - secondary activities are usually included in an income statement under the line titled net interest income. It is sometimes referred to as other income if it also includes other revenues not made from financial activities.

- **gains**
  - such as gain (loss) on sale of assets
  - it's very important to understand that gains are not considered operating income. That is also why gains and losses are sometimes referred to as extraordinary income (expense)

- **expenses generated from primary activities** are only those expenses that occur from producing operating revenues. This is listed on the income statement as "Cost of Revenue"

- **expenses generated from secondary activities**: if an expense is made by the business and it doesn't directly relate to the materials or labor used to make the primary product, it's considered an expense generated from secondary activities.
  - such as sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, other operating expenses.

- **expenses from financial activities**
  - it is disclosed as interest expenses, as they are not part of the daily business.

- **losses**
  - a loss doesn't relate directly to the primary activities of the company's product or service, nor is it a part of daily operations. It is extraordinary. Graham would caution his students to pay close attention to extraordinary items and try to assess their impact on a business, to mange and mitigate risk.
  - a loss is also the result of a difference in the value an asset is listed for on the balance sheet and the proceeds received from the sale of that asset.

- **revenue**
  - this line is sometimes referred to as Sales or Turnover.
  - revenue is simply the quantity of goods sold multiplied by the price of the product or service.
  - As an informed investor, you might need more information regarding the generation of revenue - especially if the company has a deteriorating revenue stream. You could dig deeper into the 10K or 10Q, where you'll find a section titled Net Operating Revenues.

- **cost of revenue**
  - aka cost of sales, costs of goods sold and production costs
  - It is the costs that are related to making the company's primary product or service.
  - the emphasis is placed on the term direct costs; this is because these are costs that arise as a result of per unit sales rather than any other cost driver.
  - an investor must have knowledge of the composition of the direct costs associated with the organization.
  - the investor must pay close attention to the trends in the cost of revenue. If sales are constant and the cost of revenue continues to grow, a negative trend is developing.

- **gross profit**
  - aka margin or markup
  - gross profit is simply the revenue generated from core products and services less the direct costs associated with the production of goods or delivery of service.
  - gross profit in essence is a measure of the organization's efficiency - that is, the ability of the management to control its direct cost of revenue while simultaneously increasing sales.
  - as an investor, you cannot compare the gross profit between 2 different industries. This often leads to misleading assumptions and doesn't provide relative framework to assess a company's performance.

- **sales and marketing expense**
  - sometimes it combined with Administration expenses and called SGA (selling, general and administration)
  - advertisement is one of the greatest costs incurred by corporations today and is incorporated within the income statement. Moreover, you need to distribute your product to make it available to customers. This would lead to distribution costs, which would typically also included in the sales and marketing expense line.

- **research and development**
  - cell phone companies, for example, must continuously innovate in order to remain competitive, and therefore have high research and development costs
  - conversely, companies such as Coca-cola do not have extensive research and development costs; this is because they already have a sustainable advantage through a product that has been sold for decades.

- **general and administrative expenses**
  - the labor cost related to the operation of its machines is directly associated with production and therefore is a part of the cost of revenue.
  - the salary of white-collar managers involved in running the company is not attributed to the cost of production - instead it attributable to an overhead expense that's rolled into the G&A (General and Administrative)
  - corporations are likely to window-dress the general and administrative expenses shown in corporate income statements.
- **other operating expenses**
  - refer to all the overhead costs that cannot be categorized into the major lines the company has selected to represent such as management salaries, depreciation, rent, marketing, advertising costs, costs for research into news products, operating leases and IT, etc... Think of it as a catchall category for any miscellaneous expense reporting.

- **operating expenses**
  - summation of all secondary expenses which are incurred in the running of the business.
  - a summation of all the secondary expenses gives the investor an overview of how efficiently the company has allocated overhead costs.

- **income from operations**

# financial shenanigans
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg-led5YMlo&ab_channel=TheSwedishInvestor
- Some financial manipulations, or shenanigans, are benign and may not hurt anyone.
- Shenanigans that inflate profits are of greatest concern, followed by those that hide expenses or shift revenue from one time period to another.
- Not all financial shenanigans are illegal, nor do they necessarily violate generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
- Quarterly financial reports are not independently audited, however it is highly unlikely a company will be caught manipulating unaudited reports.
- Only a small fraction of companies fraudulently distort their financial reports.
- Rapidly growing firms that suddenly face a slow down may be tempted to cheat.
- Reporting bogus revenue can destroy a company’s reputation.
- A CEO fixated on making “the numbers” at any cost is an investor’s nightmare.
- Internal auditors should report directly to the Board of Directors’ audit committee.
- The SEC should have authority to bar or suspend corporate executives and board members who become involved in fraudulent financial reporting.
- **when to be on the look out**:
  - If a company operates in a weak oversight environment, with a closely held board of directors or without a competent independent auditor, you have reason for concern. 
  - If management faces an inordinate degree of competitive pressure, that should draw your attention. 
  - If executives are known, for whatever reason, to be of dubious character or integrity, you have reason to wonder if that lack of integrity has crept over into other areas of the company’s business. 
  - If any of these indicators takes place in a previously high-flying company where growth is now starting to slow, be especially wary and on the lookout. 
  - Also be cautious about inner doings at basket-case companies that are struggling just to stay alive.
- **audit your auditor**
  - The auditors spend weeks reviewing the financial records of a company, so spend some time reading their opinions. The opinion letter will usually give a clean view, that is, it will give the report a stamp of approval. If the auditors have a serious reservation about the accuracy and fairness of a company’s financial statement, however, they will usually qualify the report. A company that receives a qualified opinion should raise the hackles on an investor’s back - especially if the qualification notes any "going concern."
  - Also look out for a situation where no audit committee exists, or the audit committee is comprised of less-than-independent members. The purpose of the audit committee is to act as a go-between, mediating between the outside auditor and the executives. Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange are required to have audit committees. No similar requirement binds most other publicly traded companies.
- **catching the crooks**
  - So how do you find out when a company is scamming you? Screening the veracity of financial reports is easier now, thanks to several Internet databases that equip you to check for signs of malfeasance. Some sites focus more on the numbers, others help you investigate a company’s footnotes, management discussions and news releases. The most widely used commercial database is Compustat, which is a product that is sold by Standard & Poor’s, a division of McGraw-Hill. Another database is sold by Factset Corporation
  - With these tools, you can run a filter for companies showing the sharpest decline in operational cash flow, as a percentage of net income. Or you can list companies that experienced the largest year-to-year sales growth followed by declining or negative growth. You can also seek the biggest increase in inventory, compared to sales. Other things you can look for include a very large deterioration in gross margins, a big jump in soft assets or a large increase in deferred revenue
- **buying trouble**
  - Acquisitions are fertile ground for chicanery. Many companies seek to buy other companies in order to rapidly accelerate their own growth, a strategy with many risks for investors. Several tricks that relate to acquisitions can be used to help cover up the underlying ill health of the purchasing company. These gimmicks include taking large write-offs before or after the acquisition, shifting loses from the deal to another time period and releasing the reserves that may be created through large write-offs. Be concerned when a firm uses very aggressive acquisition behavior in a way that might make its sales look better than they really are
- **the lessons of enron**
  - One of the lessons of Enron is to be wary when a company makes a drastic change in how it does business. This is especially the case when a company is making a transition from an easily understood model, such as acquiring gas pipelines, to a model that is far more difficult to assess, such as trading on future energy contracts. Other warning signs included the use of special-purpose entities (SPEs), that is, off the books facilities that could be used to hide either profits or liabilities. Red flags should have been flapping because Enron did not provide detailed disclosure about the purpose of the SPEs

## telling tall tales

- Accounting’s two fraudulent strategies are to either inflate or deflate earnings. 
  - The first can be accomplished by reporting an unduly large current period revenue, or by underestimating current period expenses. Manipulating either side of the ledger will work. 
  - The second, less intuitive strategy involves deflating or underestimating earnings. Why would anyone want to do that? Well, if you underestimate your financial performance, you can shift earnings to a later timeframe when you need them to cover shortfalls. Essentially you minimize current profits in order to inflate future profits, thereby making the company appear to perform better than it actually does
- Companies manipulate financial statements for three reasons:
  - **It is easy** – After all, managers themselves check a variety of options to select the accounting methods their firms will use. Managers with integrity review the options available to find a reporting method that most closely reflects the company’s performance. Unscrupulous executives, however, see the choices as an opportunity to take advantage of the system. Management is free to structure transactions or to announce reporting moves to promote the achievement of its accounting goals. For example, when using an operating lease approach, they can use lease agreements to keep debt off the books.
  - **It can pay off handsomely** – Bonuses are often tied to a company’s financial profiles, so managers have a vested interest.
  - **The chances of getting caught are slim** – Those who think they’ll get away with it are often right. For instance, a company’s quarterly financial statements are unaudited and, usually, are not reviewed by an independent CPA. When an unaudited financial report is manipulated, it is highly unlikely that the company will be caught.
- When you evaluate the validity of a company’s reporting, be aware of any misguided management incentives. These are not at all uncommon. Basing bonuses and stock options heavily on financial statement measurements create a temptation to cheat. Too much emphasis on the bottom line can cause observers to question the validity of a firm’s numbers.

## the seven financial shenanigans
- The Center for Financial Research and Analysis (CFRA) has defined 30 techniques, grouped into seven categories, that represent the ways that unethical companies dupe investors
  - **Recording bogus revenue** – This is the cardinal sin of accounting, and it can be accomplished in more ways than you might think. For example, some sales may appear to be significant, but they lack actual economic substance. Cash received in lending transactions can be recorded cleverly as revenue. Similarly, a company may try to record investment income as operating revenue. Another nasty trick is to count as revenue the rebates from suppliers that the company will receive on future purchases. And, finally, a company may release revenue that it improperly held back in the first place, perhaps prior to a merger.
  - **Recording poor-quality revenue** – All revenue is not equal. Revenue for services that have not yet been provided, for example, is poor revenue and shouldn’t be counted. Revenue should never be recorded before the item being sold has actually shipped and been accepted by the customer. A company should not record revenue if the customer isn’t required to pay. Sales to an affiliated company are also dubious. Grossing up revenue is another way to "cook the books."
  - **One-time gains** – Occasionally a company will sell assets or make an investment windfall, and count that as revenue. The problem is that this is really only a one-time gain. Similarly, a one-time gain can be used to make operating expenses appear less than they really are. Another dirty little trick is reclassifying accounts on the balance sheet in a way that creates apparent income.
  - **Failing to report future liabilities accurately** – One way a company can put lipstick on the pig is to fail to record an obligation, or otherwise move to reduce the list of liabilities improperly. Of course, owing less money makes a company look more profitable. This can be achieved by changing accounting assumptions, allowing reserves to be suddenly counted as income or creating phony rebates.
  - **Expense-shifting** – If you can stretch current expenses out so that they actually fall into a later reporting period, the results will appear to be better than they actually are. This includes reducing reserves, failing to write off impaired assets or taking too long to amortize expenses. Or, you could simply change accounting policies.
  - **Income-shifting** – Manipulation can also occur by way of shifting current revenue to a later period. This is sometimes achieved by creating a reserve account, and then eliminating it later on when the money is needed. Also be aware that companies occasionally hold back income before an acquisition deal closes.
  - **Special charges** – Even more subtle is the business of shifting future costs to the current period, as a special charge. Inflating the amount of a special charge, writing off R & D costs related to an acquisition and accelerating discretionary expenses are a few of the tricks of the trade.

## fighting shenanigans

- So what can be done to make sure there is no recurrence of Enron? Many parties must be involved in changing the way things work. Those who determine and interpret laws, and set professionals standards must establish clear parameters on proper financial accounting and reporting standards. Internal auditors should report directly to the audit committees of their boards

- The Securities and Exchange Commission, set up after the stock market crash of 1929 to supervise the nature and accuracy of information provided to investors, should be given explicit legal authority to suspend or bar any corporate executive, director or board involved in financial misdealings. Management must set the proper tone and cannot emphasize reaching its numbers above everything else. Companies should be required to have auditors review their quarterly financial statements before they are released to the public. Auditors should be held more accountable for detecting fraud during an audit.
- In 1995, the SEC, the NASD and the NYSE combined forces to commission a study recommending ways to strengthen the audit committee function. The blue-ribbon panel determined that boards of directors have to engage in active, independent oversight. The notion that a seat on a board is a reward for having "made it" in business should be replaced by an active responsibility to guide the company forward. The audit committee has to be the main body that is responsible for driving the acceptance of proper accounting practices within the organization.
- Perhaps financial shenanigans can never be completely eliminated. But certain steps can and must be taken to restore corporate credibility. Auditor training should place greater emphasis on the ability to detect accounting tricks and manipulations. Training should also be improved for those who rely on financial reports, including investors. The incentives to manipulate the numbers that are built into executive compensation packages should be re-evaluated. Investors, auditors and regulators have a much better chance of minimizing the damage that corporate dishonesty causes once they gain a better understanding of how dishonest companies pull off financial shenanigans.

If you're analyzing an unstable business, then your analysis might be worthless

A good rule of thumb is to limit the cost of your transaction to no more than 1 percent of the amount of stock you’re buying. For example if a trade costs $9.99 to execute you should buy at least $1,000 worth of stock.

Trying to beat the market is a fool’s errand.

We want the business to be one (a) that we understand; (b) with favorable long-term prospects; (c) operated by honest and competent people; (d) available at a very attractive price.

"...management may have little difficulty distorting financial reports if the company has weak internal controls."

"When companies face troubled times because of business slowdowns and other setbacks, their managers frequently take certain (bookkeeping) steps to ensure that the sun will come out tomorrow."

"Special charges offer a wonderful opportunity to artificially boost future operating profits."

"Despite the efforts of rule makers, internal and independent auditors, regulators and others working in harmony to prevent, detect and eliminate financial shenanigans, the problem continues to exist and is not likely to disappear any time soon."
