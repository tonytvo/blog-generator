# Quotes

"If you're analyzing an unstable business, then your analysis might be worthless"

"A good rule of thumb is to limit the cost of your transaction to no more than 1 percent of the amount of stock you’re buying. For example if a trade costs $9.99 to execute you should buy at least $1,000 worth of stock."

"Trying to beat the market is a fool’s errand."

"We want the business to be one (a) that we understand; (b) with favorable long-term prospects; (c) operated by honest and competent people; (d) available at a very attractive price."

"price is what you pay, value is what you get"

once you adopt a value-investment strategy, any other investment behavior starts to seem like gambling.

the key to life is to figure out who to be the batboy for.
