# interpretation of financial statements
- 3 ways that corporations can use financial reporting to enhance their value are:
  - reduce their cost of capital
  - improve their credit ratings
  - increase their price-earnings multiple
- "every debit must have a credit", double entry system.
- a well managed and profitable business will show a strong flow of cash through the plumbing of accounts from net income to growing/decreasing equity and/or dividend.
- cash based accounting:
  - transaction are recorded on the basis of inflow and outflow of cash when the money actually changes accounts, not when the service or product is provided or received.
  - useful for small businesses that operate on a cash basis, such as "mom and pop" style businesses.
  - it's not a good fit for large business due to it is slow and delayed in tracking revenues and expenses.
- accrual accounting:
  - expenditures must be recorded when incurred and not when paid. Similarly, revenue must be recorded when there is an outflow of services or goods.
  - it provides a clearer and realistic picture of the company's performance, however, cashflow statement analysis would be required to account for any inconsistencies caused from accrual accounting.

If you're analyzing an unstable business, then your analysis might be worthless

A good rule of thumb is to limit the cost of your transaction to no more than 1 percent of the amount of stock you’re buying. For example if a trade costs $9.99 to execute you should buy at least $1,000 worth of stock.

Trying to beat the market is a fool’s errand.

We want the business to be one (a) that we understand; (b) with favorable long-term prospects; (c) operated by honest and competent people; (d) available at a very attractive price.

price is what you pay, value is what you get

once you adopt a value-investment strategy, any other investment behavior starts to seem like gambling.

the key to life is to figure out who to be the batboy for.

accounting is the language of business
