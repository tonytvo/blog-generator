# key ideas
- this is huge topics, so it's continuous progress of updating references to other topics
- here's the interesting topics that has already been discussed summarized before
  - observability
  - site reliability
  - devops handbook
  - design data intensive application
  - systems performance

# Quotes


# Game Plan
- surface the critical examples based on experience.
  - it could be code, database queries, etc...
- go as broad as possible for the first attempt
- should at least include perspective from the following references
  - designing data intensive applications -> https://www.amazon.ca/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable-ebook/dp/B06XPJML5D
  - system performance from brendan gregg
  - java performance from Scott Oaks
  - [Thinking in Systems](https://www.amazon.ca/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows-ebook/dp/B005VSRFEA)
  - site reliability engineering book
  - database reliability engineering book
  - practical monitoring from mike Julian
  - observability engineering
