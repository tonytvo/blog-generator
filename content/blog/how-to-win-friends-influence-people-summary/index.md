# Principles
- Fundamental techniques in dealing with people
  - Don't criticize, condemn or complain. This makes them defensive and justifies their actions. Instead, praising them lowers their defence, and they will be more receptive to your feedback.
  - give honest and sincere appreciation
  - arouse in the other person an eager want.
  - become genuinely interested in other people
    - i.e., remember other people's birthdays
    - send LinkedIn messages of congratulations when someone in your network gets a promotion or professional success
    - coordinate office parties for personal celebrations such as births, accomplishments or birthdays.
- people crave the feeling of importance. "What is there about him that I can honestly admire?"
  - everyone has something they can teach you, and you benefit by figuring out what that is. This belief leads to genuine interest and appreciation for other people.
  - make the other person feel important and do it sincerely
  - being good with people is about making people feel good/important and being interested in them.
- appeal to the other person's interests. Virtually all people care more about what they want than what you want
  - keep asking yourself - "what is it that this person wants?"
- angry people are often angry because they feel unheard. Once you sympathize with them, they will soften their anger substantially.
- a person's name is the most important word in any language. Use it often and respect it.
- be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. Ask questions that they will enjoy answering
- To influence to do things, praise and appreciation are more effective than orders.
- talk in terms of the other person's interests.
  - let the other person do a great deal of the talking
- smile
  - approach people with a positive demeanour. Smile and be happy.
- begin in a friendly way
- dramatize your ideas. Sometimes ideas are not enough, and the truth must be made vivid, interesting, and dramatic. Television has been doing it for years.
- throw down a challenge. The thing that most motivates people is the game. Everyone desires to excel and prove their worth. If we want someone to do something, we must give them a challenge, and they will often rise to meet it.
- get the other person to say "yes, yes" immediately.
  - start with questions to which the other person will answer yes. 
  - Do not begin by emphasizing the aspects in which the other person and we differ. 
  - Begin by emphasizing and continue emphasizing the things on which we agree. People must be started in the affirmative direction, and they will often follow readily. 
  - Never tell someone they are wrong, but rather lead them where we would like them to go with questions that they will answer "yes" to 
- appeal to nobler motives. Everyone likes to be glorious in their own eyes. People believe that they do things for noble and morally upright reasons. If we can appeal to others' noble motives, we can successfully convince them to follow our ideas.
- making people glad to do what you want. Encourage people to think about everyone else's perspective, have high expectations, and help people get what they want.


# How to Lead Change Without Resistance or Resentment

- **begin on a positive note**
  - While a current relationship, whether between a company and its customers or between two individuals, might be strained or even in serious trouble, it does little good to start off a conversation on a negative note.
  - Instead, begin a conversation with honest and genuine appreciation; the receiver will be more amenable to your ideas and less defensive or resistant.

- **Acknowledge Your Baggage**
  - It isn’t nearly so difficult to be open to a conversation that may include a discussion of your faults if the other person begins by humbly admitting that she too is far from impeccable.
  - What is lovely about this principle is that we all make mistakes and so have an ample supply of stories to use when trying to put someone at ease.

- **call out mistakes quietly**
  - Leaders of all kinds have a fantastic tool available to them for sending a subtle message about the behavior they are trying to encourage. **They simply have to model that behavior themselves.**
  - In life, sometimes mistakes are the by-product of extenuating circumstances. We don’t always fail at work because of incompetence. We can fail because our hearts and minds are not engaged due to problems at home or elsewhere. The leader understands that mistakes and failures surface from all corners of life and, therefore, should be treated as isolated and redeemable instances rather than fatal flaws.
  - It is to your advantage to pull people out of their dejected state as quickly as possibly. Do so by calling out their mistakes quietly and returning them to a place of confidence and strength.

- **ask questions instead of giving direct orders**
  - Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable and reduces resentment, it often stimulates creativity and innovation in solving the problem at hand. People are more likely to follow a new path if they feel that they have been involved in shaping it.
  - Most employees have a keen understanding of their own strengths and weaknesses. While some may be obtuse, most, if you ask, will tell you exactly what you are thinking. Many organizational psychologists recommend instituting a self-appraisal stage in the review process.
  - Questions allow you to create a conversation–in any medium–that can lead to a better place for all involved.
  - Wouldn’t you rather be asked a question than be given an order?

- **Mitigate Fault**
  - A technique Sutton calls “forgive and remember,” a critical path for learning from mistakes and changing behavior. The technique was first described by Charles L. Bosk in his book *Forgive and Remember: Managing Medical Failure.*
  - The goal is to help individuals achieve accountability while managing the existential problem of failure, a demoralizing inner battle for anyone.
  - Making it safe for them [employees] to fail is a sure way to ensure that they will more readily admit their mistakes, more quickly recover from them, more fully learn from them.
  - Five actions that leaders can take to instills organizational resilience within their teams:
    - **Acknowledge that failure happens**. Leaders can acknowledge failures quickly when they happen, but they can also discuss with their teams the likelihood of failures occurring.
    - **Encourage dialogue to foster trust**. Honestly discussing problems is the best way to learn from them and to trim the seedlings before they become fully grown catastrophes.
    - **Separate the person from the failure**. Rather than saying “you failed,” say “the project failed.” In most cases, that is the truth.
    - **Learn from your mistakes**. Otherwise, they are lost opportunities for learning and for coaching.
    - **Create a risk-taking and failure system**. Being methodical about how we approach risk and failure can help mitigate some of the emotional responses to it.
  - Alberto Alessi, the great Italian designer, described his company’s approach to design as an effort to find the borderline between what is possible and what is not possible and design along it. The best designs are those that fall right on the edge of the borderline, just this side of possible. That is the space of innovation, the space where we test our talents and grow as individuals. Of course, hugging the line means that you will often flop over it–you will fall into the realm of the impossible and fail.

- **Magnify Improvement**
  - Praise and encouragement: the two essential elements of motivating any person to fulfill their potential, to improve, or to tackle change.
  - The Center for Management and Organization Effectiveness offers the following advice for praising those around you:
  - **“Deliver praise from your heart.”** Be genuine and sincere.
  - **“Deliver praise as soon as possible.”** Don’t wait for the next meeting, performance review, or family meeting. By then, the person’s own job at the success has dissipated, and you’ve lost an opportunity to amplify that joy.
  - **“Make praise specific.”** A simple thank-you note is not praise; it is politeness. To feel that their efforts are heading them down the path you want them to go, people need to know exactly what you valued in their effort.
  - **“Praise people publicly.”** Publicly praising people gets easier every day, so there is no real excuse not to do it.
  - Praise, while powerful and necessary, also implies evaluation against some standard. What great leaders and those with influence recognize is that the rest of the time, we must use encouragement.
  - That is the essence of encouragement–showing your belief in the talents, skills, and inherent abilities of another person because she exists, regardless of how things are going right now.
  - Being encouraging requires a special attitude. When you look at another person, rather than seeing her faults, you need to be able to see her strengths and possibilities, what she is capable of.
  - Tell someone that you have total faith in his ability to accomplish a goal and encourage him by highlighting all of the skills he possesses that will help him along the way, and he will practice until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel.
  - Magnify improvement and you maximize others’ talents.

- **Give Others a Fine Reputation to Live Up To**
  - Coaches, mentors, leaders, and parents often find that people live up to our expectations of them, no matter how diminished those expectations are. If a man feels unimportant or disrespected, he will have little motivation for improving himself.
  - To change somebody’s behavior, change the level of respect she receives by giving her a fine reputation to live up to. Act as though the trait you are trying to influence is already one of the person’s outstanding characteristics.

- **Stay Connected on Common Ground**
  - Why is common ground so important? For a leader to effectively influence another’s attitude or behavior, he needs to overcome any potential resistance by making the person feel glad to do what is being asked.
  - Why shouldn’t we know what our colleagues, coworkers, friends, and family members dream?
  - **Be sincere** Do not promise anything that you can not deliver. Forget about the benefits and concentrate on the benefits to the other person.
  - It is a simple process to link your desired outcomes with their goals:
    - **Be empathetic** ask yourself what is it the other person wants to
    - **consider the benefits** that person will receive from doing what you suggest
    - **match those benefits** to the other person's wants
    - when you make your request, put it in a form that will **convey to the other person the idea that he will personally benefit.**
  - In digital time and space, with open access and frequent communication, the perfunctory principles of corporate activity have largely broken down and been replaced by the basic principles of human relations.
  - Your first task remains the business of humanity

# How to approach arguments
- instead, approach with an open-minded view: "I may be wrong; I often am. And if I'm wrong, I want to change and be right. Let's discuss the facts."
- praise the other person for a trait that will help resolve the argument - like their patience, open-mindedness, fairness, and receptivity to new facts.
- understand that the other person has a valid view of the situation. Your job is to understand what led them to believe what they believe.
- express sympathy for their situation. "You have the absolute right to be upset. If I were in your shoes, I would be too"
- show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, "You're wrong."
  - listen first. Give your opponents a chance to talk through. Do NOT interrupt as they're speaking.
- ask people where they feel the problems are. Ask for their opinions on how best to proceed. Ask lots of questions instead of stating commands.
- the only way to get the best out of an argument is to avoid it.
- look for areas of agreement. Try to build bridges of understanding. Talk about common goals and what you agree on.
- let the other person feel that the idea is his or her.
- emphasize how your position serves the other person's interests and incentives.
- if you're wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically
- the only way to get the best out of an argument is to avoid it.
- anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is interested in the same things as you are. Think of them as people who want to help you.
- poop sandwich method
  - bread: sincere appreciation
  - poop: bad news
  - bread: a compliment.
- how to keep a disagreement from being an argument
  - Welcome the disagreement
  - distrust your first instinctive impression
  - control your thoughts/temper. You can measure a person by what makes him/her angry. Little people get angry over little things. Big people are undisturbed and keep cool
  - listen first
  - look for areas of agreement
  - thanks your opponents sincerely for their interest
  - postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem.

# How to give feedback
- begin with praise and honest appreciation, be specific.
- introduce the point of improvement
- talk about your own related mistakes
- call attention to people's mistakes indirectly
- ask questions instead of giving orders
- give the person a fine reputation to live up to. Act as though the trait were already one of his/her outstanding characteristics.
- let the other people save face.
- be "hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise".
- praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement.
- be specific with your compliments and don't give everyone the same compliments.
- Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.
- frame the improvement in terms of the person's own interests.

# Quotes
"Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment. ... Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain - and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving"

"If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own."

"Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don't criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be"

"We're not logical, we're emotional, motivated by pride and vanity"
